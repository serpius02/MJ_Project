On the other hand if you’ve been searching for a world-class nursing program, you’ve probably found your ideal match in Baylor. Whatever your criteria, you’ll need to spend some time digging through the school website for details that will breathe life into your vision and reasons for applying. By that same token, you’ll want to spend some time reflecting on the personal qualities that would make you an excellent nurse or help you take your a cappella group to the next level.

While you might be tempted to get technical or poetic, this essay will be more personal and memorable if you can share a story. What excites you and why? When was the last time you got drawn down a Wikipedia rabbit hole and what was the topic? While you don’t need to recount the unabridged origin story of your interest, try to zero in on a formative experience: the best book you’ve ever read, the first time you spoke French to an actual French person, that one time when you used PEMDAS in the real world!

What’s one eye-opening experience that made you believe healthcare could be your calling? Perhaps it was a single moment, like watching an ambulance come to your neighbor’s house. Or maybe it was something more long-term, such as navigating your school in a wheelchair after knee surgery and realizing you want to improve patient outcomes by researching physical therapies. Whatever the case, use your personal story as the backdrop for your argument. What did you learn? What problems do you hope to tackle? What change do you hope to help create? As we said, it’s not enough to just want these things; your job is to show admissions why medicine interests you personally.

You have to be intentional about how you allocate the words at your disposal here. Start by describing the community service activity that has been most meaningful to you. Bring the story to life by including concrete, personal/sensory details rather than a verbatim recitation of the organization’s mission and vision (or worse, a bloated list of clichés related to the value of service). Next, dig into how this experience changed your view on a particular social issue. Did volunteering at a soup kitchen open your eyes to the harsh realities of day-to-day life for people experiencing homelessness? If so, how have you tried to be a part of the solution since having this enlightening experience? Remember that, fundamentally, community service is not about personal glory or achievement; it’s about doing what you can to help others. Reflect on why being part of a community that looks out for each other is important to you and, for bonus points, touch on how you would like to contribute to social justice at Georgia State.",

If you can build a bridge between your own interests and the resources available at MIT, you’ll be well on your way to demonstrating your fit. So set aside a few hours and commit to some hardcore research on the MIT website. (Sorry, there’s no way around this, folks!) Beyond the basic departmental listings, look up information about news and research coming out of your department of interest, the kinds of courses available, and the opportunities other undergrads have had studying in your area of choice. Even if you have a wide array of interests, consider explaining how two or three departments might complement each other or foster your interest in a larger theme or cross-pollinating kind of way.

Or, if religion wasn’t a huge part of your upbringing, what led you to take an interest in a Christian university? Perhaps you’ve more recently developed an interest in philosophy and ethics, and you think it would be valuable to study these topics in a religious context. Whether you consider yourself a religious person or not, faith is a central component of the Pepperdine education, and now is your chance to figure out how you’ll fit in.

The Residential College System is at the heart of Rice student life and is heavily influenced by the particular cultural traditions and unique life experiences each student brings.

This prompt is a spin on the classic Community Essay: what do you bring with you to contribute within the residential college system, specifically? Consider your hobbies, culture, and any other extracurricular activities you do just because you love them. One great way to choose a topic is to ask yourself: if I had a podcast, what would it be about? More than likely, you’ll come up with a topic that not only interests you, but you also want to share with the world. Along with pinpointing what you’re passionate about, try to think of how you can enrich the lives of your peers. Do you teach a craft? Do you strongly believe in paying it forward? What would your friends say is your “superpower”? These are all ways to break into a discussion of what you bring to the table and what you would do to enrich your new community. 2. Rice is strengthened by its diverse community of learning and discovery that produces leaders and change agents across the spectrum of human endeavor. What perspectives shaped by your background, experiences, upbringing, and/or cultural identity inspire you to join our community of change agents at Rice? Odds are that this isn’t the first Diversity Essay prompt you’ve come across this year. If it is, however, please read on. Rice wants to accept students from a range of backgrounds who will contribute to their community, so tell admissions about what makes you you and how you will strive for positive change within the student body. Think about times when people have been intrigued by or curious about your identity, skillset, or background. Maybe you began practicing meditation and Buddhism during your sophomore year and you hope to spread some wisdom and mindfulness on campus next fall. Perhaps your parents emigrated from Ukraine, and you intend to raise awareness or funds for refugees. What do you hope to share with others about your lived experience? How will you incorporate this element of your identity to enrich the world around you? Show admissions that you’re eager to make your mark in their community.

Admissions is hoping you’ll engage with a diverse range of students, faculty, and other community members on campus and, understandably, they are curious to hear about a time when you encountered someone with a different worldview. So, tell them about a fitting situation or encounter and describe the resolution or conclusion accordingly. Maybe you challenged your cousin’s beliefs about climate change over Thanksgiving dinner. Or, perhaps, you questioned your uncle on his remarks regarding reproductive rights during a game of mini golf. Whatever conversation you decide to write about, remember to describe each party’s viewpoint accurately. Admissions knows that these conversations are rarely resolved and wrapped up in a bow, so don’t feel pressured to sugarcoat the ending. Instead, reflect on how the encounter may have been resolved differently. This means reflecting on your own actions, as well. Perhaps next time, you’ll try to ask more questions rather than sharing more of your own opinions. Maybe, if a situation like this presents itself again, you plan to make more of an effort to communicate your point, since you usually shy away from confrontation. Show Sarah Lawrence that you are not afraid to consider new ideas, advocate for topics that are meaningful to you, and engage with others about important issues.",

Also make sure the activity, experience, job, or responsibility you highlight is something you are clearly invested in. Don’t choose to elaborate on a fundraiser to which you contribute five hours of your time, twice a year. This is a good place to feature a work experience if you have one, as that is something that often feels less standard than an internship or activity in which many other students participate. For example, tell admissions about the summer you spent working at a hot dog stand and how it taught you about responsibility, organization, and portable fans. That said, even if you write about a national club or organization that other students may feature, the trick to nailing this essay is personalization. Why is this the activity or experience you have chosen to highlight? How were you a contributor and how will it impact your ability to be a contributor on campus? How has participation made you a more compassionate, assertive, or responsible person overall? And how will this experience impact your future? You don’t have a lot of space here, so make sure you focus on personal and powerful details that other people could not replicate.",

The instructions counsel you to “select questions that are most relevant to your experience and that best reflect your individual circumstances,” and frankly, we couldn’t agree more. A strategic applicant will choose a constellation of the UC essay prompts that highlight vastly different aspects of their lives and personalities, leaving an admissions officer with a deep and complete picture of who they are. Don’t get hung up on trying to divine the questions admissions wants you to answer. In the end, they just want to get to know the real you, plus the application swears that “there is no advantage or disadvantage to choosing certain questions over others.” So follow your heart (!) and don’t let the fatigue get to you. Avoid robotically starting every answer by restating the question and be as anecdotal as possible. With each essay, your goal isn’t just to answer the question, but to tell a very short story about yourself.",

It can mean being a mentor to others, acting as the person in charge of a specific task, or taking the lead role in organizing an event or project.

Did you help to resolve an important dispute at your school, church, in your community or an organization? And your leadership role doesn’t necessarily have to be limited to school activities. For example, do you help out or take care of your family? When answering this UC personal insight question, avoid the siren song of your resume. This question isn’t asking you for a list! Remember: it’s your job, as an applicant, to use every essay as an opportunity to reveal something new about yourself. Think of a moment when you were in a position where you worked really hard to help a group of people. Maybe you are always the one helping your younger siblings with their homework, and you struggled to find ways to engage your dyslexic younger brother with math. Maybe, as a camp counselor or church volunteer, you were in charge of choreographing and instructing a number for a group of seven-year-old hip hop dancers to perform. Perhaps, on a Habitat for Humanity school trip, you became the head cook, whipping up everything from pancakes to chicken fajitas while galvanizing a team of sous chefs to pitch in. The point is, try to isolate a single leadership moment, and bring it to life with vivid details. Describe where you were, what was happening around you, and what you were feeling. Discuss what challenges you faced, and what you ultimately learned from the experience. Don’t shy away from challenges or even failures, since these are exactly the sorts of character-building experiences that can demonstrate resilience and quick thinking.",

Does your creativity relate to your major or a future career? You may think that this UC personal insight question was geared towards the artistically inclined, but take a closer look. The wording offers many potential definitions that veer away from traditional conceptions of creativity (and actually, it asks you for your personal definition!). Creativity lies in your outlook: seeing the opportunity to use one of your skills in a novel situation; looking at a problem from a new angle to find the solution that no one else could see. This question is, in reality, ideal for the more scientifically oriented to create a more well-rounded profile. Creative types, on the other hand, might want to proceed with caution since, really, every question is an opportunity to show off your talents and describe your artistic endeavors. No matter who you are, though, remember this classic writing advice: show don’t tell. So, you claim that gardening, or Calculus, or painting is how you show your creative side. Okay. So, then immerse the reader in this activity with you. If you enjoy gardening, describe the plants, their qualities, and how you make your horticultural choices; are you drawn to the aesthetics or are you botanically inquisitive? Similarly, if your subject is Calculus, show the reader how you sat in your dad’s office for six hours straight trying to calculate Pi on a three dozen sheets of paper using red crayon. If you love to paint, show the reader where you paint, what you paint, and why you paint, describing the colors, textures, materials—the essential process behind your art.

Does your talent or skill allow you opportunities in or outside the classroom? If so, what are they and how do they fit into your schedule? If question 3 reminds you of question 2, you’re not alone. Often, when we talk about a talent or skill that we have honed over the course of a lifetime, we’re inclined to describe it as an art — a creative extension of who we are. So if you choose to respond to both of these UC personal insight questions, make sure to highlight distinct skills in each. The good news is: finding your subject should be easy! You just need to answer this question: what makes you proud? Think about the stories that your friends and family like to share about you. Think about moments when your hard work paid off. When you can zero in on an experience that makes your heart swell, you’ll be able to pinpoint your essential subject. If the memory of your first swim meet victory still makes you smile, draw us into your rigorous training schedule; describe the aspects of the sport that motivate you to wake up early and push yourself.

If you choose to write about educational barriers you’ve faced, how did you overcome or strive to overcome them? What personal characteristics or skills did you call on to overcome this challenge? How did overcoming this barrier help shape who are you today? This question is tricky because it has two parts. So first break the question down: You can write about either A.) How you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity OR B.) How you have worked to overcome an educational barrier. The “or” is key. You are not being asked to write about both parts of this question. Just write about one. If you have participated in an afterschool program, internship, honors program, or a special class that was meaningful or inspiring to you, you will want to think about choosing option A. Maybe it was an afterschool program for young, aspiring lawyers, or an advanced history class that you took at your local community college. This is an opportunity for you to showcase your ambition and highlight the kinds of challenges that engage and excite you. Beyond underscoring an academic interest, reflect on the personal qualities required for you to succeed. And remember to show, not tell! It will save you from accidentally humble-bragging your way through this assignment. Now, for option B. If you have worked to overcome a disability, struggled in school because you have a different background than your peers, suffered financial hardship, or something along those lines, you can choose to write about option B. To nail this tricky task, you will need to highlight not only the ways you struggled, but also the qualities that helped you succeed. How would you define yourself? Resilient? Hardworking? Brave? Zero in on a quality that resonates with you, and write targeted descriptions that bring it to life. (No one is going to believe you if you just write, “I am resilient,” and leave it at that.) Lastly, reflect on how this barrier shaped who you are today, and what skills you gained through facing this educational barrier.",

If you’re currently working your way through a challenge, what are you doing now, and does that affect different aspects of your life? For example, ask yourself, “How has my life changed at home, at my school, with my friends or with my family?” If you skipped question 4 or chose to write about option A, this question is a gift: a second chance to showcase your resilience in the face of obstacles. On the other hand, if you chose to write about option B in question 4, this might feel redundant. You are free to write about both, but again, proceed with caution and be sure to select a totally different challenge. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: questions that ask you to describe a struggle or failure are really probing for stories about success. What pro-active steps did you take to address the problem at hand? Even if your solution didn’t work out perfectly, what did you learn? In facing this challenge, did you discover a courageous, creative, or hard-working side of yourself? Did you learn something valuable about yourself or others? Highlight the upside.

What did you learn from your effort? How did your actions benefit others, the wider community or both? Did you work alone or with others to initiate change in your community? Some backwards advice: When writing about community service, you should always start with yourself. Community service essays are cliché minefields. To avoid drifting into platitudes, you need to ground your writing in the specificity of your life. Don’t start with the action and end with what you learned. Instead, dig into your motivations. If you spent weeks petitioning your school community to raise the hourly wage for custodial staff, what prompted you to act? What assumptions did you have about income inequality and what did you learn about your community in the process? Or, maybe you weren’t too enthused about your community service. Maybe you participated in a soccer-team-mandated day of coaching a pee-wee team. What caused your skepticism? How did you turn the experience around? Also, don’t just choose a topic that sounds impressive. “This year I acted as the co-chair of the Honors Society, presiding over twenty different cases.” If you didn’t, in fact, really enjoy Honors Society, write about a topic that means something to you instead. Think of a moment where you felt like you made a change in your local community. It can be something small; it does not have to be monumental, but it should mean a great deal to you.

Will joining the Club Crew team help you feel more connected to aquatic life despite your midwest location? One thing you won’t find on the school website, though, is that third piece, that “future” thing. Think about where you’d like to be five or ten years from now—your career, the impact you’d like to have, or even just a geographic location. How will a UChicago education help you get there?

How do you plan to contribute to this effort and how will your time at UIUC set you up for carbon neutral success? (Maybe their Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences major is a good place to start?) Whatever way you decide to answer this prompt, be sure to show admissions that you have an actionable, long-term goal in mind.",

You’re allowed (encouraged, even!) to have many interests, and admissions wants to know where your strengths lie. Why does this secondary area of education appeal to you? What applications can you see blossoming from studying in this field? We recommend doing another dive into UIUC’s course offerings to show that this isn’t just an afterthought; additionally, feel free to share any previous experiences (in or out of the classroom) that have led you to this choice. Once you’ve succinctly demonstrated your interest, look to the future and explain how UIUC’s offerings will help you achieve your end-goals when it comes to your selected second-choice area of study.",

Literally set a timer and force yourself to keep your pencil moving (or fingers typing) for the entire time. No idea is too silly!

Then spend some time on University of Rochester’s website to understand how you might use their courses, research opportunities, student clubs, or other unique offerings to start making those changes. Maybe you’ll major in Politics and pair a Language and Cognition cluster with a Russian Literature and Culture cluster to prepare for a future career as a diplomat to your grandmother’s native country. Perhaps with a double major in International Theater and Black Studies, you will study abroad through the Theatre in England program, gaining insight into how different cultures express cultural clashes on stage with the aim to found your own theater promoting Black creatives. Show admissions that you have an idea of how your time at U of R will help you promote progress in your communities. Note that while you have the option to write an essay for this question, you may send in a work of art or an abstract describing your related research instead. This is a great option for students who express themselves more authentically through outlets other than writing. However, if you choose one of these options, you’ll still have to send in a short explanation of how your response relates to creating positive change within your community.",

To answer these questions, set aside an hour or two to pore over the USC website (there’s no hack, you’ve just got to put in the time). Beyond the basic departmental listings, look up information about news and research coming out of your department, the kinds of courses available, the opportunities that other undergrads have had studying in your area of choice.

Are you hoping to major in Environmental Studies? Do you like to sit in the woods, meditating on the breeze in the trees and how connected all living things are? Does nature ground you? Your experience with the environment is personal, and if you feel comfortable, admissions would like to hear about it in your own words.",

Be true to yourself. Maybe the soundtrack of your life would be “Born to Run” by Bruce Springsteen, because A) you’ve been itching to explore the world since you could walk and B) you and your sister sing-scream it at the top of your lungs anytime it comes on in the car. Or perhaps your song would be “Girl on Fire” by Alicia Keys 🔥 because you’re a tenacious competitor who has always had the fire in her belly.

In fact, there shouldn’t be a single sentence that only lists a feature of the school without any connection back to you or what that it means to you.
