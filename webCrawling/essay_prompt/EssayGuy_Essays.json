What would you do with the extra time before starting classes? If your mind spins with possibilities, or if you already have a solid idea, you may be the perfect candidate for January Enrollment. Note that the rather large range of words allowed (25-200) means exactly what it seems to mean: You can answer more briefly, or if you have more to share, use the full word count. We’d recommend using as many words as it takes to show Babson you’ve carefully considered and researched January Enrollment as an option.\n\nTips for approaching this essay:\n1. Be specific about your plan. If you already know what you plan to do, great! Go beyond what you envision, and get into the why. Explain, for example, that you want to hike the Appalachian Trail, following Emma Gatewood’s steps and her example of resilience. How would January Enrollment bring this dream to fruition? Take this to the next level by identifying skills you’ll develop.\n2. Be specific about your goal. It’s okay if you don’t have a plan already in place, as long as you have a goal and an idea or two of how you can get there. Maybe public service is your goal and you want to volunteer for a political campaign or advocacy group. Propose ways to get involved, and connect your immediate goal to your long-term goal.\n3. Be specific about the value. Whether you have a plan already in place or you have a set goal to pursue, pitch the value of the experience. Bring in your own values and connect your ideas to Babson’s values. What aspirations do you have for personal development, and what added value do you hope to bring to campus in January?",

Imagine a mini-movie of the moments that led you to your interest and create a simple, bullet-point outline.\n2. Put your moments in chronological order, as it’ll help you see how your interests developed. It also makes it easier to write transitions.\n3. Decide if you want to include a specific thesis that explicitly states your central argument—in this case, what you want to study and why.\n\nPart 2: “Why us?”\nWe recommend checking out our complete guide on how to write the “Why us?” essay—pay close attention to the “Why Cornell” and “Why Penn” examples, which are our favorites.\n\nAs you write, try to avoid these common mistakes: Writing about Babson's size, location, reputation, weather, or ranking; simply using emotional language to demonstrate fit; screwing up the mascot, stadium, team colors, or names of any important people or places on campus; parroting the brochures or website language; describing traditions Babson is well-known for; thinking of this as only a 'Why them' essay.",

The possibilities are endless, so be creative about how you define community.\n\nAdditionally, don’t shy away from being honest if you once held a viewpoint or perspective that you don’t anymore. This shows growth, and the important piece is to let the reader know how your current views lend themselves to collaboration. Finally, pay attention to the last part of the prompt … how will you CONTRIBUTE TO and LEARN FROM the community at Babson? What do you hope to bring to the Babson community? What do you hope to gain?

For CMU’s essay, try one scene per short paragraph. Step #3: For CMU, you’ll likely want to include a specific thesis that explicitly states your central argument—in this case, what you want to study and why. This thesis can come at the beginning, middle, or end of your essay. Once you have those pieces, you have a few structural options: Opening: A hook that thematically sets up where you’ll take us, and ideally shows an aspect of your intellect/personality.

Another option: Go wider—name the road you hope to follow ahead (for example, career path, organizations you’d like to work with, the greater value/implications of studying what you want to).

'Inclusion' is defined as the social norms, customs, and behaviors that welcome people from many walks of life. Think about the clothes people wear and the way they talk. Think about the types of food people eat, what music they listen to, and what holidays they celebrate. Looking deeper, inclusion refers to the way institutions permit or punish certain groups for certain behaviors. In this way, inclusion takes things one step further than diversity.

You don’t have to find the formula to world peace for your reader to care. Something local can be just as powerful in an essay as something global here. Start with a topic you’re genuinely interested in, and go from there. \n\nStill stuck? Here are two ways to brainstorm for this prompt ...\n\nIssue → History:\n1. Think about general issues you care about or challenges you feel you can improve through some kind of action. Past students, for example, have written about climate change, LGBTQ+ rights, gun restrictions, access to water, the criminal justice system, and the gender wage gap. Think of topics that inspire you to want to take action. Even better, think about why that issue means something to you. Does it connect to your identity in some way? Has it affected your life or your friends’ or family's? Was it something you were passionate about in high school?  \n2. Narrow the topic down to a specific aspect that seems extra important. If you were writing about climate change, that could be something like fast fashion or toxic rain runoff. Basically, get into the nitty gritty.\n3. After you’ve identified a more specific issue you care about and you’ve connected it to yourself in some way, research its history. Think about what you’d want changed about the issue in the present moment and then go back in time to identify how you’d achieve that change retrospectively. In the case of fast fashion, maybe you’d make it so that a big clothing brand like H&M never burned its excess clothes, or make it an industry norm that clothes were upcycled through congressional regulation. The world is as wide as your imagination. Think big, but also don’t be afraid to think small and local.\n\nHistory → Issue:\n1. Think about a historical moment, figure, event, or choice that intrigues you. Perhaps it was the 'dancing plague' of the 1300s, the Kent State Vietnam protests, the unregulated rise of social media platforms like Facebook, or the Chinese Exclusion Act. Nothing is too big or too small.\n2. Start tying the history to values and issues. So, for instance, the Chinese Exclusion Act was deeply rooted in institutional racism and anti-Asian hate in the United States. It’s tied to issues of power, immigration, and equity over who qualifies to be a 'worthy' American. At this point, you should start to see how the history you find interesting is connected to issues we still face today.\n3. Last, connect the issue back to you. Keeping with the Chinese Exclusion Act example, it could be about how countering anti-Asian discrimination speaks to your values or life experiences. Perhaps you identify as Asian, or you're from a family of immigrants. Or perhaps you’re a community-oriented person who’s benefitted from your involvement in organizations with lots of different perspectives, teaching you to value diversity in problem-solving.",

The key to that approach is good brainstorming.\n\nHere are some steps you can take before you start writing:\n1. Start with our Values Exercise. This will give you a sense of what motivates you and what you might want to highlight in your supplemental essays.\n2. Spend a little time mapping out which communities you’re a part of and which are most important to you. Keep in mind that communities can be defined in a variety of ways, including place, culture, interests, political beliefs, hobbies, even your favorite sports team. Get creative.\n3.

Use some of your response to show the idea or issue you care about and how you’ve engaged with it already, and then show how those experiences shape what you will bring to the college through linking to specific opportunities/groups/details.

You can probably start by reflecting on your activities list—is there an issue you’ve engaged with and that sparks your curiosity/interest that you’ve devoted time to exploring and addressing? And think about books and articles you’ve spent a lot of time reading and (ideally) acting upon. Have you spent time exploring how to create green spaces in your community, for example, or petitioned your local government about changing certain intersections because you’re fascinated by public safety and design, or… you get the idea. STEP 2: USE THE BEABIES EXERCISE TO GENERATE YOUR ESSAY CONTENT. You’ll find detail on the BEABIES Exercise + a chart you can use at that link. STEP 3: DO SOME 'HOW WILL YOU CONTRIBUTE' RESEARCH. You’ll want to offer a few specific ways that show how the experience/s you’re discussing in your essay will allow you to contribute to the college, and how you can continue to explore/engage with the idea or issue.

First thing’s first—if you haven’t read anything about the Honor Code yet, now’s a great time to start. You don’t have to click too deeply on Haverford’s website to know that the Honor Code is a pretty big deal to Haverfordians, so it’d be a good idea to at least have a big-picture understanding of it. Once you’ve taken some time to read through it, you might realize that three key values are referenced repeatedly: trust, concern, respect. Your mission in this supplemental essay is to make clear how you’ve demonstrated one or more of those values in one of your communities. Let’s talk about how to do that! First, you might check out our step-by-step guide that offers a short exercise to help you think through which communities you are a part of that might make a good topic for this essay. One of the key takeaways from that guide is that what counts as a 'community' can be pretty broad. We’d recommend you check out the whole guide, but here’s the short version: Step 1: Create a 'communities' chart by listing as many of your communities as you can think of. Keep in mind that communities can be defined in a variety of ways, including place, culture, interests, political beliefs, hobbies, and even favorite sports team. Get creative. As you brainstorm, try to think about instances where you embodied Haverford’s foundational values of Trust, Respect, and Concern. Were there moments in these communities that could parallel the aspirations of the Honor Code? Step 2: Use the BEABIES exercise to generate your essay content for 2-3 of these communities. As you explore your role within each community, keep the principles of Trust, Respect, and Concern front and center. Ask yourself and jot down notes to these questions: In what ways did you foster an environment of mutual trust in that community? How did you demonstrate respect for diverse perspectives and backgrounds? Were there instances where you showed genuine concern for the well-being and growth of fellow community members? What kinds of problems did you solve or work to solve (personally, locally, or globally) in that community? What specific impact did you have while embodying Haverford's core values? Step 3: Pick a structure for writing this essay and focus on the community that you feel is most compelling and reveals the most about you, and connect those experiences to how you will impact the Haverford community.",

But that advice doesn’t actually apply to all students equally. Here’s why: We’ve spoken with people inside Penn State’s admissions office, and they’ve said that the Penn State admissions process relies heavily on academic data/info, and not as much on the writing. They get 100k applications, so it isn’t feasible to read everything. In certain situations, it could be helpful to use the optional writing section 'if the application is hand read' (implying that many decisions are academic data-based and writing isn't considered). They get 100k applications, so it isn’t always feasible to read everything. Using the Common App PS alone is totally fine. The opportunity to add more is great (if it will be additive), but there's no penalty for not doing it at all. Because of those points, we think whether or not you write something additional here depends on how you compare to other applicant profiles. As mentioned above, a large part of Penn State’s process is academic data-driven—so take a look at things like the academic profiles of first year students. If you’re solidly above those middle 50% ranges, the optional essay might be worth skipping if you’re already a strong candidate without special circumstances, so you can use that writing time elsewhere. (Though if you’re taking a super essay approach and adapting a supplemental essay you’ve already written for another school, rather than writing from scratch, the writing time may be minimal.) If you’re below or around that middle 50, this might be an opportunity to strengthen your application. Insider tip: be sure you are showing with this 'optional' Penn State essay how you fit with the college and what you will add to the school/community. For how to approach this essay: This prompt itself is about as broad as it gets. Penn State wants you to elaborate on some aspect of your life experiences, identity, or actions that would highlight your ability to succeed on campus should you be accepted. Think of this as a slightly smaller personal statement that gives you a chance to make your application more multifaceted. To be clear, this should not be a repeat of what you already wrote in your Common App personal statement (assuming you’re submitting it, which, again, we recommend). What you write for this 'optional' prompt can be connected to things you’ve already written, but it should bring something new to the table. If you’re not sure where to start, we would recommend checking out our Values Exercise, 21 Details Exercise, Essence Objects Exercise, Everything I Want Colleges to Know About Me Exercise, and Feelings and Needs Exercise to dig deeper.

Explain how the topic would 'contribute to the Reed community.' This is an important part of the prompt, and part of what makes this different from other, more standard 'create your own course' essays. Take some time (and with 500 words, you have it) to elaborate not just on what you’d teach but why. That 'why' should help convey the significance of your topic, and why it could make an impact on your fellow Griffins.\n2. Maybe share required readings. Give the reader a sense of your mad research skills. Look up your topic on Amazon (or better yet, on scholar.google.com or The Seminary Co-op’s catalog) to find books or articles that pique your interest on the subject. If you find one that’s slightly off-topic from your course, that’s okay. Make an uncommon connection. Find a unique way of linking multiple interests. Remember that classes can be interdisciplinary, so don’t limit yourself. The key here, since this essay should be written in traditional paragraph format, is not to merely list out a bunch of titles students would read—pick a few of your favorites and expound on what you hope/expect your classmates to get from reading these books or articles.\n3. If you name sample lectures, do so in a dynamic way. Again, imagine lectures you’d like to hear. Try to find those uncommon connections. Use the sample lectures as a way to demonstrate the breadth and depth of your knowledge about your topic of choice—and again, expound on the 'why' and 'what for.'",

    "general_essay_guidelines": "Essentially, college admission officers are looking for three things in your essay: Who is this person? Will this person contribute something of value to our campus? Can this person write? Ideally, your essay will communicate these answers to the above questions: An interesting, versatile, dynamic student (and human) with much to offer the Spelman community, as evidenced by this fabulous essay. An enthusiastic yes—check out all the ways. Ta-da! Personal statements differ from a typical five-paragraph, argumentative English class or research essay in a few ways. While class essays are meant to showcase how a student thinks, personal statements should illustrate how students think, feel, work, play, and live. This means that, unlike most English class essay assignments, personal statements are great spaces to confidently use 'I' statements, get a little vulnerable, and show the reader who you really are.",

Here’s how you can formulate a solid response. By asking about a question that matters to you, Spelman wants to learn in what ways you’re the kind of critical, insightful thinker they want on campus, leading the drive for future change. They also know that being able to formulate and ask critical questions is as (if not more) important than having the answers. After all, what’s college for if not to widen your thinking and give you the resources and confidence to help you solve the unsolvable? So don’t feel as though you have to have all the answers—raising interesting, complex questions that Spelman can help you explore can be just as (or more) useful. And note that while your issue doesn’t necessarily have to relate to your major or future career path, that can make it easier. In the second half of your essay, you can add some 'Why us?' detail. But don’t treat the whole essay as a 'Why us'—instead, help Spelman see some of who you are through what you care about, and then you can show how your interests, values, and goals merge perfectly with Spelman’s.",

While this student was writing a response to a similar prompt for Brown, one way to make it more fitting to answer Spelman’s prompt is to use some of the available word count space to make the issue clearer earlier in the essay. What we do know is that this student is interested in the environment and many aspects related to it: plant life, human pollution, and economics. In the second paragraph, we learn that certain classes at Brown will help this student learn more about the issue. Include examples or activities to illustrate your interest. In this student’s first paragraph, they mention their community service trip to Tanzania and their economics summer program at Oxford in the context of how these activities supported and expanded their interests. This is a great way to add new information beyond the activities list, as well as connecting the dots between your past (what you’ve done) and your future (what you want to do in college). While listing off activities can often come off as a rehashing of your activities list (which you don’t want to do), this student creates a narrative arc around how their activities have helped them further these interests or learn more about these issues, which they can continue to learn more about at the university level. Do your research and elaborate. This student’s last paragraph makes it really clear that they did their research on how Brown would help them answer their questions. Similarly, be sure to demonstrate how Spelman offers classes, professors, programs, etc that will help you develop and grow in ways that will make you better able to address the issue you’ve raised. And dig into why: For example, the student lists a series of classes, then elaborates by saying these classes emphasize 'the intersection of science and economics to determine how to allocate finite resources to meet current needs and use technology to address public health.' This shows how you’re going to use your college education to explore these issues, that you know your stuff, and are enthusiastic about the possibility of attending that school.",

For detail on “Why us?” essays, we recommend checking out this complete guide on how to write the “Why us?” essay—paying close attention to the “Why Cornell” and “Why Penn” examples, which are our favorites. Here’s the short version of how to write the “Why us?” essay: Spend 1 hr+ researching 10+ reasons why Tulane might be a great fit for you (ideally 3-5 of the reasons will be unique to Tulane and connect back to you). Make a copy of this chart to map out your college research. Outline how you will (concisely) use those details to show why you and Tulane belong together. As you write, try to avoid these common mistakes: 1. Writing about the school's size, location, reputation, weather, or ranking. 2. Simply using emotional language to demonstrate fit. 3. Screwing up the mascot, stadium, team colors or names of any important people or places on campus. 4. Parroting the brochures or website language. 5. Describing traditions the school is well-known for. 6. Thinking of this as only a 'Why them' essay. For the “How will you contribute” portion, there’s a guide + examples with analysis at that link, but here’s the short version. Essentially, a way to think of this kind of prompt is that it’s a combo of “community/identity/background” and “why us” prompts: use some of your response to show how you’ve become who you are, and then show how those experiences shape what you will bring to the college through linking to specific opportunities/groups/details. Connect your unique upbringing, in a very broad sense of the word, with what the school offers and how you will make a great team. One last tip: The prompt is careful to emphasize that you should talk about “how you will apply what you learned to our community in a positive way.” It’s important that you don’t skip over this part in your answer. In recent years, Syracuse has been confronting ongoing student concerns about diversity/self-segregation and safety, and by including this piece in its supplemental essay prompt, school officials are demonstrating a commitment to these core principles. If Syracuse is a university you’re seriously thinking about attending, take some time to think deeply about how you’d fit into its growing mission of safety and equity.",

While this prompt is technically optional, we’d recommend writing it (especially since Tulane also recommends writing it), and using it to demonstrate why you and Tulane fit together. You can treat the first part of the prompt (“why you are interested in joining the Tulane community”) as a “Why us?” essay, and the second part (“your experiences, talents, and values to illustrate what you would contribute to the Tulane community if admitted”) as a “How will you contribute” essay. For detail on “Why us?” essays, we recommend checking out this complete guide on how to write the “Why us?” essay—paying close attention to the “Why Cornell” and “Why Penn” examples, which are our favorites. Here’s the short version of how to write the “Why us?” essay: Spend 1 hr+ researching 10+ reasons why Tulane might be a great fit for you (ideally 3-5 of the reasons will be unique to Tulane and connect back to you). Make a copy of this chart to map out your college research. Outline how you will (concisely) use those details to show why you and Tulane belong together. As you write, try to avoid these common mistakes: Writing about the school's size, location, reputation, weather, or ranking; Simply using emotional language to demonstrate fit; Screwing up the mascot, stadium, team colors or names of any important people or places on campus; Parroting the brochures or website language; Describing traditions the school is well-known for; Thinking of this as only a 'Why them' essay. For the “How will you contribute” portion, there’s a guide + examples with analysis at that link, but here’s the short version. Essentially, a way to think of this kind of prompt is that it’s a combo of “community/identity/background” and “why us” prompts: use some of your response to show how you’ve become who you are, and then show how those experiences shape what you will bring to the college through linking to specific opportunities/groups/details. Connect your unique upbringing, in a very broad sense of the word, with what the school offers and how you will make a great team.",

To help brainstorm ideas for this prompt, you can ask yourself: The main question: Where would you go? The more specific, the better. For example, if your initial answer is just 'Japan,' you might consider going more specific by doing some research, so your response ends up being something like, 'Hokkaido, Japan, because…' And you can take it a step further: 'The Asahiyama Zoo in Hokkaido, Japan, because…' And this isn’t just limited to location—you can time travel, too! Examples of questions to gather specifics (you may or may not end up including all answers in your response): Why would you go there? What would you learn from visiting this destination? Who would you go with? Based on the above answers, you can ask yourself: What values show up? There are so many possibilities for how this essay could be written based on the values that show up. For example, someone who values family might write about touring around Italy with their parents and siblings, or visiting family members in Taiwan, while someone who values adventure might want to try and get their SCUBA certification in Costa Rica.

This essay offers the opportunity to delve into specific experiences with community that have shaped your perspective on life, education, and more. 2. How will you contribute? Make sure your answer to this question is clear. How have these experiences positioned you to make an impact at Miami? What do you bring to the school and community (in ways that maybe others don’t)? While it doesn’t have to be truly unique, it’s great to aim in that direction: the best response will highlight a contribution that only you (or maybe you plus a few other applicants) would think to make. Again, one important aspect with this prompt is its focus on your contribution to the Miami community. Another detail to note is Miami’s encouragement to show where you come from—the people, places, and things that have shaped who you are today. This is your chance to connect your unique upbringing, in a very broad sense of the word, with what has helped make you unstoppable. So take it. Keep in mind that you’ll want to include some “how will you contribute” details in your essay—this isn’t just a “tell us about a community” prompt.",

Hopefully, the topic you’ve chosen is something you’re already pretty jazzed about. The key here is getting your reader to be just as jazzed as you, and showing impact is the way to do it.

Call up the face of someone still alive who years ago did something or said something that changed your life for the better. Someone who you never properly thanked; someone you could meet face-to-face next week. Got a face? Gratitude can make your life happier and more satisfying. When we feel gratitude, we benefit from the pleasant memory of a positive event in our life. Also, when we express our gratitude to others, we strengthen our relationship with them. But sometimes our thank you is said so casually or quickly that it is nearly meaningless. In this exercise … you will have the opportunity to experience what it is like to express your gratitude in a thoughtful, purposeful manner. Your task is to write a letter of gratitude to this individual and deliver it in person. The letter should be concrete and about three hundred words: be specific about what she did for you and how it affected your life. Let her know what you are doing now, and mention how you often remember what she did. Make it sing! Once you have written the testimonial, call the person and tell her you’d like to visit her, but be vague about the purpose of the meeting; this exercise is much more fun when it is a surprise.

It was impossible to go to college during this time of crisis, so I took the year off to support my family. Many days, my dad and I would talk. Our new game was one of curiosity. How do you feel? Who are you? That spring, my dad beat cancer. Although that year was hard, it was defined by a clearer understanding of my relationships to others. I was profoundly affected by the new bond I shared with my father. My fascination with connectedness in times of crisis led me to take an online course in advanced psychology and design an independent research project on psychotherapy.

What is it that you’ve learned about UVA through your personal connection that’s made you want to spend the next few years of your life roaming its halls? The key is to be detailed and specific. 2. The second part of the prompt invites you to be self-reflective, so take advantage of the opportunity to do so! Once you’ve established your connection to UVA, let your readers know how you will use this specific connection to make a contribution to the school. Maybe you have a family member who works at UVA in admissions, for example, and through that connection and the things you’ve learned about how students transition into college life you’ve decided you want to work with 1st generation college students in some way. Again, the key is to be specific in connecting your personal connection to the space you want to carve out for yourself. 3. Wherever you can, shine a light on your values. When discussing how you want to leave your mark on UVA, let your values drive this part of your response. For example, if you participated in a UVA leadership program, explain what you learned, how it shaped you, and why leadership is important to you.

Can you write?\nBecause this prompt can essentially be anything you want it to be, it’s important that you come in with a game plan before sitting down and writing. Great brainstorming is the first step toward a great essay. Here are five exercises for you to try out as you begin to look for a topic:\n- Essence Objects Exercise (12 min)\n- Values Exercise (4 min)\n- 21 Details Exercise (20 min)\n- Everything I Want Colleges to Know About Me Exercise (20 min)\n- The Feelings and Needs Exercise (15-20 min)\nIf you’re short on time and can’t do all five, we recommend completing the first two. Carving out some time and tackling those exercises will help give you a blueprint for an essay that better amplifies the story you want to tell. Based on your topic, you might choose to write a narrative essay or a montage essay. A narrative essay is often centered around a challenge or series of challenges and follows a more linear storyline, whereas a montage essay is a series of moments or experiences connected by a common thematic thread. We have more details about what those approaches look like and what they require in our extensive guide on How to Write a College Essay. No matter what you end up writing about, a standout essay will often do three things: focus on an uncommon topic, make uncommon connections, and use uncommon language.",

A number of schools ask some variation on this question on their applications, so you may be writing more than one of these 'Why us?' essays during your college application journey. Here are six common mistakes to look out for, and avoid, when answering:\n1. Writing about the school’s size, location, reputation, weather, or ranking.\n2. Simply using emotional language to demonstrate fit (i.e., 'It just felt right').\n3. Screwing up the mascot, stadium, team colors, or names of any important people or places on campus.\n4. Parroting the brochures or website language.\n5. Describing traditions the school is well-known for.\n6. Think of this only as a 'Why them' essay.\nThe common theme here is: Do your research. Most of these mistakes are the result of students not taking the time to conduct a thorough dive into a college’s website and available resources. Really take your time with this prompt and find specific clubs, events, professors, classes, etc., that pique your interest. Most importantly, connect those specific opportunities to your specific values (remember the Values Exercise). Remember, this essay is a two-way street. Talk about not just what UW can offer you, but also what you can offer the university.",

This essay offers the opportunity to delve into specific experiences that have shaped your perspective on life, education, and more. 2. How will you contribute? Make sure your answer to this question is clear. How have these experiences positioned you to make an impact at Vanderbilt? What do you bring to the school and community (in ways that maybe others don’t)? While it doesn’t have to be truly unique, it’s great to aim in that direction: the best response will highlight a contribution that only you (or maybe you plus a few other applicants) would think to make. Again, one important aspect with this prompt is its focus on your contribution to the Vanderbilt community. Another detail to note is Vanderbilt’s encouragement to show where you come from—the people, places, and things that have shaped who you are today.

This prompt offers you the opportunity to show just how well you walk the walk and talk the talk (and, well, write the essay). How? In four easy(ish) steps: Step 1: Find your “what” and “why.” Don’t feel like this activism had to have been big. Maybe you organized a Black Lives Matter event in your small conservative town that resulted in a mindset shift among local leaders and law enforcement. But maybe you simply volunteered to register 18-year-olds to vote in front of Town Hall. No less important or impactful. More important than the size of the event is how passionate you are about your topic. So think: What is it that really matters to you? What topic engages your inner problem-solver? Is it gun violence in school? Dress code equality? Vaccine mandates? Step 2: Now identify your “who.” You can take a similar small-to-large approach when considering the community you’ve advocated for. Remember: You belong to a number of communities. Family, school, work, teams and clubs, neighborhood, state, global. And you serve unique roles in each. To help you brainstorm this part, here’s a guide that can help you think through the different communities you’re a part of. Step 3: It’s time to outline your “how.” What specific actions have you taken—not just to raise awareness about this societal issue, but to also take concrete action toward creating that equity and justice? It could be as simple as a conversation or as big as a foundation you’ve started (or bigger). Villanova wants to see those concrete steps that have transformed you from “thoughtful idealist” to “action-oriented changemaker.” Step 4: When you go to write, heavy up the details. While the devil may be in the details, the details will help you show your commitment to equity and justice in one or all of the communities you belong to. Tell that richly detailed story about your efforts. Let the admission officer see you’re more than a thinker. You’re someone who takes action—and Villanova is the place to do it.",

That said, the prompt asks specifically for you to elaborate on a lesson you’ve learned. When you explain what you’ve learned, try to be as succinct as possible. You want your reader to walk away knowing your answer to the question.

Whether it’s academic, personal, emotional, or physical, the clearer you are about the challenge, the better readers will understand the context. A reminder that it doesn't have to be a dramatic life-altering event. Once you’ve identified a challenge, identify the “others”. I.e., who are the folks who borrowed your strength? Maybe it was a friend you lent an ear to, or a family member you supported. It could even be a group or community you're a part of. By highlighting these individuals or groups, you're showcasing aspects of who you are and what you value. Finally, reflect on the mutual exchange, as strength is often a two-way street. While you offered strength, were you also supported? How did your experiences shape how you interact with your community or peers?

Being part of a 'community' can take a lot of different forms. Don’t limit yourself to a narrow definition. An essay on a strange talent (like juggling while jogging) or an obscure interest (like historically accurate baking, for example) might be more apt to catch the reader’s attention. And, yes, those are real examples from past students. 3. Details! Be specific. The more visceral details you can give about yourself and the community you’re discussing, the more you distinguish yourself from all the other applicants. Use memorable language and evoke unique images that will stick with the admissions officers. 4. How will you contribute… Note that while the language is slightly different, the end of the prompt essentially asks how you’ll engage with the William and Mary community.

Make a copy of this chart to map out your college research. 3. Create an outline for your essays based on either Approach 1, 2 (recommended), or 3 in the full guide above. 4. Write a first draft!",

Think about situations that tested your limits, made you uncomfortable, or required you to adapt. 2. Reflect on impact. Consider how the challenge or adversity affected you on a personal, emotional, and psychological level. Did it push you out of your comfort zone? Did it change your perspective on certain aspects of life? Reflect on the feelings and thoughts that emerged during and after overcoming the challenge.",

        "prompt_text": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute seeks students who are the right fit for its academic and campus community. In what ways are you the right fit for the distinctive educational and campus experience that Worcester Polytechnic Institute offers? (500 words)",
        "word_limit": "500 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you a classic “Why us?” essay with an emphasis on “why me.” And WPI allows you ample room for your response: 500 words. While you might be thinking, “Oh, no—500 words?,” we’re thinking, “How spectacular—500 words!” Here’s how to make this word count work for you.\n\nFirst, you’ll need ample space to address the “Why us?” part of the essay. (If you need a refresher on what this essay is and how to write it, check out our full guide here.) You’ll be doing a deep dive into WPI, both on its website (digging into the course catalog and campus life descriptions) and by searching the web for other mentions of the school (like professors making great discoveries in your field of interest). The goal? To show you’re clear on the educational and extracurricular opportunities WPI offers and how they’ll help you further your interests, expand your horizons, and pursue your goals. Remember: This doesn’t need to be a 1:1 correlation—matching each of your current interests directly with one of WPI’s existing programs. Instead, you’re encouraged to consider mentioning opportunities WPI offers that you’ve previously not had access to and showing your enthusiasm to be the curious learner WPI values.\n\nBut, wait! There’s more. Now that you’ve shown WPI why it’s your dream school and a perfect match, it’s time to show admission officers why you’re their dream student: an enterprising scholar, bold innovator, and dedicated leader (enter the “why me” part of the essay). To do that, you’ll clearly show the value that your past experience, learning style, and future goals will bring to WPI.\n\nTips + Analysis\n1. Be strategic. Because this is a longer essay, structure and organization are critical. So, before you start writing, consider outlining your essay following a format like this (which, unsurprisingly, is not unlike how this student organized his essay):\n   - Opening/thesis (say what you want to study and why)\n   - Really specific academic offering at the school that’s in your intended major/concentration (this should connect to you in a really specific way)\n   - A second really specific academic offering that’s also in your intended major/concentration (and that also connects back to you)\n   - Something academic that’s not in your intended major/concentration (this keeps the focus on academics, but also brings in some variety)\n   - Best/most important extracurricular offering (that connects to you in a really specific way)\n   - Miscellaneous extracurriculars paragraph (2-3 things to demonstrate social/non-academic fit)\n2. Dig below the surface. While it’s easy to focus on the easy-to-find information—like WPI’s project-based approach to learning, seven-week terms, or its unique grading system—that alone won’t impress admission officers. But connecting your passion for clean energy with Associate Professor Yu Zhong’s grant to study hydrogen fuels, for example, just might. Take time to dig deep and show why WPI, of all schools, is the place for you to call home for the next four years. The student above strikes a balance between the two, connecting potentially superficial (but highly relevant) reasons to attend (grades and quarterly system) with deeper ones (the Objet260 Connex 3D printer and how he’ll work with three of WPI’s professors).\n3. Show off new sides of you. This prompt also gives you the opportunity to go into more detail about your skills, talents, interests, and passions. If there’s something you haven’t been able to mention elsewhere in your application, or haven’t emphasized it enough, can you weave it in here? This might’ve been this student’s only chance to share more about the portable optical machine he’s been working on, and by elaborating on it, he’s then able to easily transition to connecting this interest with the resources available to him on campus.\n4. Show your impact. You might tell WPI officials you two are a match made in heaven, but what you really want to do is show them. The difference, you ask? Your best friend could tell you they sat next to Justin Bieber on a flight from New York to L.A. But until they show you that picture, you might not believe them. Make sense? So it’s time to offer up some cold, hard proof that shows your interest in WPI is more than just lip service. This student does this with each part of his essay—like when he mentions his interest in IQP’s focus on solving real-world challenges then backs it up by explaining how that program will let him bring the vision of his eye care nonprofit to life.",

Step #2: Put your moments (aka the “scenes” of your mini-movie) in chronological order, as it’ll help you see how your interests developed. It also makes it easier to write transitions. Step #3: You’ll likely want to include a specific thesis that explicitly states your central argument—in this case, what you want to study and why. This thesis can come at the beginning, middle, or end of your essay. Once you have those pieces, you have a few structural options: Opening: A quick hook that thematically sets up where you’ll take us, and, ideally, shows an aspect of your intellect/personality.
