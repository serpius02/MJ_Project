        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "First, although this prompt is optional, we strongly encourage you to respond. College applications are limiting by nature, so you should take advantage of any extra opportunity you have to show admissions officers who you are. Especially at relatively selective schools like American, you never know what could make the difference! In terms of brainstorming for this particular prompt, American’s admissions committee wants to see what drives you, whether that’s a belief, hobby, idea, issue, or topic. They also want to see how you might contribute to their campus community as a changemaker, or someone who can lead others to make a positive difference. In other words, this essay is an opportunity to showcase your enthusiasm for something particular, and demonstrate how this passion reflects your overall character and values. Consider these questions to help you decide what to write about. Is there something you could talk about for hours? Is there something you’re more knowledgeable about than the average person? How did that come to be the case? When have you worked hard to change something, or realize a vision of yours? What drove you to work on this project? How is your ideal future different from the world we live in today? What are you doing to bring about that ideal future? When considering potential topics, you want to pick something you’re genuinely enthusiastic about, as that energy will come across tangibly. Connecting your passion to your future, particularly at American, is another great way to show how serious you are, both about the interest described in your essay and this specific institution. Do be aware that, although you likely have many different subjects you could talk about, you’ll want to focus on just one thing. You want to provide detail, and illustrate what this passion says about you more broadly. With only 250 words to work with, if you try to jump from one idea to the next, you’ll quickly run out of room. One last brainstorming tip: you want to avoid writing about a common topic, like sports or volunteering, unless you have a truly unique angle from which to consider these subjects. While picking something that absolutely nobody has ever done before is practically impossible, if you’re thinking of writing about something that the majority of high schoolers have also done, you’ll likely want to pivot. Finally, you want to make sure you’ll be able to connect with the 'changemaker' theme. You might be able to write an excellent essay on how you believe Taylor Swift is the greatest songwriter of all time, but if that passion doesn’t inspire you to accomplish or work toward anything, it’s not a good choice for this essay.",

        "word_limit": "300 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is fairly broad, so you can approach it in a few different ways. We recommend writing a sort of blend between a 'Why This Major?' essay and an extracurricular activities essay. Focusing on an aspect of your intended major will show your passion for something inherently intellectual, and throwing in some of your other interests/hobbies will add nuance and personality to your response. Before you begin writing, you’ll want to gather your thoughts so that your essay will have structure. Think of the following questions as a way to focus your thoughts: 1. What piques your curiosity and interest the most? What are your authentic reasons for being interested in this thing? 2. What are some specific examples of things that you enjoy with regard to this interest? If this is something you’re truly curious about, you shouldn’t describe it generically. Instead of thinking 'I love reading,' think 'I enjoy reading novels that explore existentialist philosophical themes.' 3. How might pursuing this thing serve your life and/or career goals? Is your curiosity about this thing a driving force in your plans for your future? For example, are you so curious about ocean life that your biggest life goal is to become a marine biologist? 4. Is this interest primarily academic or extracurricular? What are your best experiences with this interest both inside and out of the classroom? 5. Is there any recurring emotional experience that you have when exploring this thing that piques your curiosity? Why do you find that experience or state of mind appealing? 6. How has this thing influenced your development as a person? Have you developed or strengthened any personality traits or skills as a result of your object of interest? Questions 4, 5, and 6 will be especially helpful when you’re trying to recall some anecdotes to support your interest and curiosity in it. You only have 300 words to work with, so you should keep your response limited to one thing you’re deeply curious about (or maybe two if they’re related). A strong essay will do a few things: First, it will show that you have nuanced interests with intellectual depth. Second, it will talk a bit about the trajectory your life has been on as a result of your interests. Finally, it will display an important part of your personality that can give the admissions committee an idea of who you are as an individual. There are a couple of common mistakes you should avoid when writing your response: Picking the wrong topic. Bad topics include: an interest you already wrote about somewhere else in the application; an interest that sounds impressive, but that you aren’t very invested in; one you haven’t spent much time on. Writing a generic statement about why the interest you chose is interesting or cool without addressing the personal connection you have with it. It’s great to appreciate your own interests, but you need to show the admissions committee why the thing that makes you curious is so important to you.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is a slightly more specific version of the 'Why This College?' prompt. However, you’re being asked why you’re drawn to the AU Honors Program in particular rather than to American University as a whole. The prompt is meant to assess a few things: First, it’s meant to see if you know what you’re getting into with the program. If you’ve done your research on the Honors Program, you should have something detailed to say about it. Second, it’s intended to determine how you will fit in the program. The admissions committee wants to know what role you’ll have in the program and how you’ll make use of its resources to achieve your goals. Finally, it’s an effective way for the admissions committee to see which students are genuinely interested in the program. Before you begin writing, make a list of the reasons you decided to apply to the program. You might find it helpful to explicitly jot down the things that drew you to the Honors Program in the first place. One of these reasons might very well be the subject of your essay. You should also explore the Honors Program website to make sure you don’t miss any of your reasons. The prompt asks specifically for the aspect that most piques your interest, so you have to figure out if you want to write about an academic reason, an extracurricular one, or an intangible one. Let’s go over what makes each of these unique. Academic reasons are as straightforward as they sound. Things such as the Honors Colloquium courses, the Honors Capstone, and research opportunities are academic aspects of the program that you might want to write about. Extracurricular reasons include activities and opportunities that are supplementary to academics. Things such as Honors housing, the Student Advisory Council, and the 'Have You Ever Wondered?' discussion series are extracurricular aspects of the program. Intangible reasons are those that involve values, beliefs, and other nonphysical things. The program’s commitment to interdisciplinary thinking and the BIPOC Affinity Group’s dedication to 'an empowering and supportive environment' are examples of intangible aspects of the program. Your reasons for being interested in the program don’t have to be the most exotic or outlandish; you can write an effective straightforward response to this prompt. The thing that piques your interest the most might be the Honors Colloquia, the opportunity to engage with Program Associates, or the opportunities in Honors housing. All these options are valid ways to establish a tangible connection with the program.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is, in essence, a version of the common diversity prompt that many colleges provide. Colleges often include diversity prompts so they can learn something about your personal background and its influence on your worldview. In June 2023, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. Nevertheless, the ruling allows colleges to consider race on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts as one of their supplemental essay prompts. If you feel that your racial background specifically has impacted you significantly, this is the response in which you should write about that. More generally, you can respond to this common prompt with a fairly traditional answer. One tried-and-true method you could use involves identifying the most important part of your identity, then discussing how that aspect of your background is relevant to you and your life experiences. Before you jump into writing your response, think of aspects of your background that may have had an impact on the way you look at the world or the way you live your life. Some examples of things that have likely influenced your worldview include: Personal identity. Your race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, etc. all have a profound influence on the way you think and perceive the world. Cultural identity. Your religious affiliations, political views, socioeconomic status, social class, and even the place you are from influence what issues you see the most, and what solutions you envision for these issues. Personal history. Things in your life may have an average trajectory. Maybe you’ve had a fortunate life with few obstacles to overcome so far, or maybe you’ve experienced a great deal of adversity or tragedy. The way things generally tend to go in your life will have a great impact on how you view life and the world around you. Interests. The things you’re really invested in can change how you perceive the world. If you’re a musician, for example, you might find musicality in the most mundane sounds out in the world on a daily basis. That said, there are several angles with which you could approach this prompt. Some more specific examples of aspects of identity you might write about include: Having a disability that has changed your perspective on something in the world. Being a member of an ethnic group that has an interesting cultural practice. Fluency in another language that you use to help members of your community. Being a member of a fandom. You have 300 words to work with, which is a considerable length, so feel free to structure your essay using an anecdote. You might begin with a time when your worldview was different, then describe how it changed due to the aspect of your background that is the subject of your essay. One thing you should avoid is simply listing out things that generate diversity. Diversity includes everything mentioned above and more, but just writing out a list of things contributes very little to your application and also fails to respond to the prompt. The prompt asks you which singular aspect of your background you would like to share, so make sure to choose wisely and elaborate.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "In this prompt, you are asked to give your opinion on the greatest challenge facing humanity today. This sounds like a very tall order, but don’t worry; it’s an opinion question, so any reasonable challenge you choose will be fine. Admissions committees want to see specifics, so we often recommend not identifying too broad a problem. In the brainstorming stage, however, you can think as broadly as you’d like. Global poverty, world hunger, illiteracy in developing countries, human rights abuses—each of these things can be an effective starting point. Thinking about your identity and values might help you determine which issues are most important to you. Aspects of your identity include your ethnicity, race, country of origin, language, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, hometown, income class, socioeconomic status, illnesses/disabilities, and even interests and activities! Consider these different aspects of your background and list broad world issues that may have an impact on some part of your identity. For example, you might be Ukrainian and have family members directly affected by the current war. In this case, your ethnic background may compel you to write about geopolitical conflicts or human rights issues. Be sure to narrow your topic to something specific once you begin writing. Even though the prompt asks what you think is 'the greatest challenge facing humanity today,' you should be prepared to discuss concrete examples of that challenge. For instance, if you want to write about world hunger, try to also describe particular situations and specific problems related to that broader issue—some things you might want to examine in such an essay can include widespread food and water shortages in Venezuela as a result of governmental policies, hunger in Haiti due to food insecurity and currency inflation, and the impending famine in Sudan as a result of internal conflicts. The aforementioned examples can add a great deal of nuance to your essay for a couple of reasons. First, citing specific instances of your chosen challenge goes beyond simply stating that your challenge exists. It creates tangible reasons to be concerned about the issue. Second, having a few concrete examples demonstrates that you are informed and knowledgeable about the issue. Once you have decided on a global challenge and have thought of a few examples to support your point, reflect on how you might be able to contribute to a solution to this problem. This program is offered by the School of International Service, so you will be pursuing a degree in International Studies. You might already have some ideas about how you wish to help solve your chosen problem, but your essay will be even better if you can connect your goals to the school and degree. Read up on the BA in International Studies and the Global Scholars Program to inspire your writing! There really is no wrong way to envision yourself as part of the solution. Consider the following hypothetical students to see how contributions can vary: A student who’s passionate about the environment might say that climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity, and might describe how it has devastated different communities around the world, including his small coastal town, which has experienced worsening floods. He might hope to major in International Studies to eventually work in the United Nations and be a part of climate change conferences and agreements. A student who wants to be a doctor might say that lack of access to good, inexpensive healthcare is the greatest global challenge. She could describe how the U.S. healthcare system fails many low-income people, and how poorer countries lack the infrastructure and resources to treat easily treatable illnesses. She hopes to go to medical school then join Doctors Without Borders to help those in conflict zones and those facing disasters get the treatment they need. This prompt is meant to gauge which global issues you deem important and how you intend to use your college education and degree to contribute to ongoing efforts to solve these issues. You’ll have a strong essay as long as you’re sincere and write about a problem you’re personally invested in.",

What you choose to write about doesn’t have to be a singular experience; a situation in this context can be something much larger. You can choose to describe any experience—academic, personal, extracurricular, and so forth—in your answer. Like most other prompts, the key will be in how you not only relate your chosen situation to your personality, but to the Global Scholars program at large. Think first about your identity and your environment—are there any distinguishable experiences in which you have always felt that you’ve had an uphill battle or unfair disadvantage? Think about periods of your life in which you may have had to undergo a major transition or change. Regardless of the situation you choose, remember that the best answers come out of asking yourself questions. This applies equally to a situation you may describe that does not involve your identity or environment—you can also approach this prompt by thinking about any life-altering events that forced you to pivot or make a change. For example, maybe COVID-19 left one or both of your parents unemployed, and you had to pick up a job on top of your schoolwork. While you may have expected to be able to handle the part-time job, perhaps you saw your schoolwork and relationships begin to slip through the cracks and you were forced to really reevaluate your time management skills. You may end up writing about an experience that is similar to that of other applicants, so it’s how you relate it to yourself and to your environment that will make you stand out from the crowd. Make sure you continue to emphasize your emotions and honesty throughout your answer, and lastly, try to relate your chosen experience back to the Global Scholars program at large. You can conclude by writing about how you hope to apply what you learned from your life experiences to your participation in the Global Scholars program—how you hope to apply your newfound understanding of various financial or personal circumstances to learning about various cultural and global circumstances.",

        "word_limit": "500 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This might seem like a daunting prompt, but it can be easier than it seems. Don’t worry about having some grandiose, impressive tome to talk about for this essay. If you think creatively, you should be able to identify moral complications in simpler texts. This is the kind of essay that really benefits from careful argumentation. Brainstorming your topic: There are two kinds of texts that would probably make for a strong essay: Texts you’ve read recently, which should still be fresh in your mind. Texts you’ve read a long time ago and still remember because they were impactful or profound to you. It’s important that you pick one of these kinds of texts because you’ll want to write about something you know well enough. If you choose a text that you don’t really remember, or worse, a text you haven’t read that looks impressive, your points will probably be shallow and superficial, which will drag the overall quality of your essay down. As far as the text itself is concerned, you can write about nearly anything (just make sure it’s not too trivial, like a children’s book). Perhaps you have read a clearly morally complex text, such as Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables or Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird. If you have, and you remember the details well enough to explain your choice, then by all means write about it! However, if you haven’t read a text like that, that’s fine too. Think of things you’ve read recently that have moral dilemmas you might discuss. For some idea on how you might stretch the theme of morality, consider some examples: Lois Lowry’s The Giver, a young adult novel, discusses themes related to individuality and emotional depth and can be pitted against order and conformity. This moral conflict leaves a lot of room for debate, as the balance between individuality and societal conformity is one that is often hard for individuals to navigate. Marvel Comics’ Civil War, a seven-issue comic book storyline from 2007, has a plot centered around the U.S. government requiring super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to be superheroes under official regulation. While this may not be a traditional text, it has been acclaimed for its exploration of the conflicting desires of security and freedom that are still discussed in American politics today. Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs, the authorized biography of Apple’s co-founder, is a thorough look at the life of the controversial business magnate. It discusses not only his great achievements in the worlds of business and technology, but also his personality, which has been described as abrasive or difficult at times. This text allows students to examine the ways in which massive corporations, their employees, and their consumers can be directly affected by the very human individuals who lead them. As you can see from the above examples, you can find and argue for moral complications almost anywhere you look. You might use a traditional example of a large, classic novel with clear and distinctive moral ambiguity, or you might explore some more creative options, such as biographies, YA novels, and even comic books or graphic novels! Tips for writing your essay: A good response will answer every part of the prompt. You should strive to identify the text, explain how it’s morally complicated, and detail your reasons for recommending it. The first and last part shouldn’t be too hard once you’ve settled on your text—naming the text and talking about why you’re recommending it are tasks that you can probably do easily if you know your chosen text well. After all, you know why you like the book. It’s the second part of the prompt that will require some more careful thought. Effectively explaining how the text is morally complicated is only something you can do if you’re familiar enough with the text and its themes. Oftentimes, the moral complications of a book aren’t directly relevant to the plot—they’re often a thematic consequence of a character’s actions or are intended to be seen behind the main narrative, but not the focal point of the text itself. That said, it might actually be a good idea to consult online summaries, videos, and study guides of the text you chose. Of course, you should absolutely have read the text and have a decent grasp of its material, but this isn’t a test for school—you can and should see how the moral themes are discussed by other readers. This will inform your argument that this text should be used in discussions among first year students. Mistakes to avoid: There aren’t too many ways to tackle this prompt incorrectly, but there are a couple of things you should avoid, which have already been mentioned but are worth repeating: Choosing a text you aren’t familiar with, just because it looks more impressive. It’s better to write a thoughtful, intelligent essay on a text that might be seen as lackluster than to write a shallow, generic essay on a text seen as impressive. Remember, the admissions officers aren’t making decisions based on books you have or haven’t read—they’re making decisions based on the quality of your essays. Choosing a trivial or juvenile text. Most young adult novels should be complex enough to be valid texts for this essay, but don’t try to be overly creative by writing about something for little children. Children’s books are intentionally written in a way that does not deal with the complex, intellectual themes that you’re tasked with discussing here. As long as you pick a decent text (i.e., one you’re familiar with that isn’t too trivial), describe the ways in which it deals with questions of moral complexity, and make a good case for its use in Caltech’s first year classrooms, you’ll be well on your way to crafting a strong response.",

Moreover, in addition to describing how the program is a good fit for you, you’re tasked with describing how you are a good fit for the program. Brainstorming your essay: A recommended strategy for prompts like this is to establish a connection to the program. Two kinds of connection you might try to establish are a tangible connection and an intangible one. A tangible connection can be made by identifying specific program offerings that resonate with you personally. To find such resources, you should do some in-depth research on the program. A good place to start is the PPL Scholars website. There you’ll find the course of study, the applicable majors, information about the living learning community, and more. You might write about things like the campus culture, specific classes or academic opportunities, particular professors, etc. Given the rather low word limit, try to stick to academic features, as others might come off as less important. An intangible connection can be made by discussing how your personal values align with those of the program. The PPL program emphasizes 'the principles, practices, and institutions of politics and law from quantitative and qualitative, philosophical, and social science perspectives.' If your personal values deeply resonate with the ideas of practicing law, government, public policy, criminal justice, or a similar field, you might wish to discuss how those values will be supported and informed by those of the program. Tips for writing your essay: Since you only have 250 words to work with, it would be a good idea to choose either a tangible connection or intangible one to discuss, rather than both. Remember, you need to save some space to discuss how you’re a good fit for the program. Also note that it’s okay if you can’t develop a really strong intangible connection to the program—that is usually the harder kind of connection to write about.

As such, the admissions committee wants to ensure that you’re able to support a larger community of like-minded (or even sometimes diversely minded) students. First, think back over your time in high school and try to identify any large-scale projects that you were involved in with a group. At the same time, keep in mind that this response should not just be more explanation of something that may already appear on your application. When selecting what to write about, try to fill in the gaps your application has. For instance, perhaps you were on the Executive Board of Model UN, and hope to share an experience about how you organized a conference hosted at your high school. While that’s definitely a valid experience, this answer should be less about the what and more about the how. How did that conference come together? How did you delegate responsibilities among your peers and which responsibilities did you take on? What challenges or obstacles did you face as a team and how did you overcome them together? Did you have to work through any conflicts when working with one another? Ultimately, reflect not only on your accomplishments with whichever experience you choose, but also on the failures, conflicts, and honest strategies you chose to employ to keep the ship afloat.

The purpose of this prompt is to get a sense of your level of political engagement, as well as to give you a chance to attempt your first case study, which will serve as a gateway to the PPL program at large. This essay will require thorough research and deliberation, but, at its core, it’s just an expanded version of a typical Political/Global Issues prompt. First, decide the scale of your chosen issue. Trying to brainstorm a list of possible issues to focus on will end up generating a laundry list of options, and might exhaust your brain before you even begin writing your response. Something that may help guide you is remembering that you should have a unique perspective on your chosen issue. For example, you wouldn’t want to write your response about something general like the dangers of climate change if you genuinely don’t have anything to add to the conversation—the point is not to reiterate discourse that is already out there, but rather to think creatively and critically about the world and the ways in which your unique perspective can be valuable in trying to solve your chosen issue. Therefore, it may be more useful to start small and then expand outwards. Look at your environment—what issues impact your community, your state, or your region? Looking again at the issue of climate change, perhaps you come from a state where fracking is not only legal, but still actively occurs. Perhaps your own family or a family you know has ties to the fracking business, and you feel as though current legislation and efforts to outlaw fracking stall because of pushback from these communities. Tie your belief to your perspective—you may believe that fracking should be illegal, and your perspective can guide you in persuading an elected official to provide various incentives to those who rely on fracking for their livelihoods. As such, starting small will make your answer more specific and unique while still tackling a national issue like climate change. If you don’t feel as though your environment has given you a distinct perspective on a current event, do some research on what issues have most recently surfaced in the country. For example, recent months have called attention to a migrant crisis that the United States is facing and how resources for these migrants are quickly diminishing. Regarding this example, perhaps you are very active in community service and volunteering—how can you use that interest to frame your answer? Your proposed solution can involve rallying young people to volunteer and provide support to these migrant communities, while also trying to work with the opposing party to reach a solution. Remember, your answer still needs an official policy proposal, so perhaps your proposed solution can immediately provide temporary shelter and resources for migrants while also opening the door to a firmer long-term solution. Your proposed solution doesn’t have to completely close the door on an issue, but it should showcase your understanding of the political process.",

Talking about a school project you did focused on public health is a good starting point, but describing how you’ve sought out additional knowledge within the field on your own time will take your response to the next level, by demonstrating your self-motivation. At the same time, you don’t want to spread yourself too thin. 500 words is on the longer side for a supplement, but you still probably want to stick to 3-4 experiences–more than that, and the essay will start to feel cramped and rushed. You want to have enough space to use anecdotes to anchor your statements and paint a vivid picture for the admissions team of yourself as a public health fanatic. One last thing to avoid is being overambitious. Aim high, but aiming too high can make you come across as naive, rather than realistic about what progress in this field is possible, and the role you see yourself having in advancing it. For example, rather than saying you want to cure cancer, talk about how you want to spread awareness among young people of when you should have your first cancer screening, so that people get more proactive about scheduling their appointments.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a version of the Diversity essay, which means the admissions committee wants to know how your experiences, identity, or worldview will enrich the program. You’ll want to consider the distinct qualities, background, or insights you bring to the table, and how they fit with the program’s collaborative learning environment. As you brainstorm, the first thing to remember is that diversity can mean a lot of different things. Features like race, gender, or sexuality probably come to mind first, but diversity can mean other things, too. What else can diversity look like? An unusual extracurricular, hobby, or activity that has had a meaningful impact on your life. A religious tradition, spiritual belief, personal ethics, or code of values that guide your life. A community that you are a part of that centers on something besides identity, like a shared passion, life experience, or future goal. Basically, diversity can be any aspect of your identity that is truly meaningful to you, and will help admissions officers understand who you are and how you’d fit into this program. One thing you do want to keep in mind is that the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action in June 2023, which means that American is unable to directly consider racial identity in their admissions decisions. However, they can factor in race or ethnicity as part of the broader fabric of who a student is, namely through the essay. So, if your racial or ethnic identity is important to you, you may want to highlight that here, as otherwise admissions officers will have no way of acknowledging it. In terms of actually writing the essay, first, as always, you’ll want your essay to be personal and specific–something only you could write. Vivid descriptions of actual experiences you’ve had will be much more effective than simply speaking generally about something. You’ll also want to show off your capacity for deep reflection, by connecting the diverse features of your identity to your interest in this program.",

This prompt is meant to gauge your reasons for applying to the program to see if you’re a good fit for it and if it’s a good fit for you. To write a successful essay, you‘ll need to establish a connection with the program and express how your goals are best served by being a part of it. There are two kinds of connections that you can make with a college, program, major, etc. The first kind is the tangible connection. This involves identifying specific concrete reasons for applying to the program. To do this effectively, you will need to do in-depth research on the program and its offerings. Go to the program’s website to begin your research. Scroll through the main site and the FAQ page to learn more about the program. In this program you have the choice of starting your undergraduate career at American University or Ritsumeikan University, so be sure to check out Ritsumeikan University’s program site as well! This will help you determine where you want to spend your first semester. The program awards a degree in Global International Relations, so a good approach to this essay is to describe why the field of international relations is important to you and how the program is uniquely equipped to help you achieve your goals in this field. One direct way to establish a tangible connection between the program and your goals is to find courses or faculty members that really resonate with you. Since the program is between two universities, you should look through the faculty lists of both American and Ritsumeikan. The second kind of connection you can make with the program is an intangible connection. This involves things like seeing if your values and those of the program are aligned. For example, you might appreciate how the program takes place in the East and West, emphasizing 'voices, experiences, and theory from a truly multicultural, multiregional, global perspective.' There are some things you’ll want to avoid when writing your response: Name-dropping. Don’t simply list activities, courses, or professors that interest you without explaining why you’re interested in them. This essay needs to be about you more than the program itself. Empty flattery. Anyone can write about the reputations of AU and Ritsumeikan. Compliments are nice, but empty flattery suggests that you don’t have anything more substantive to say. Generic aspects of the program. Talking about good locations, a strong program in international relations, or small class sizes won’t really add to your essay. Try to write about unique aspects of the program or things that are rare.",

You’re being asked about a challenge you faced as well as the lessons you learned from it. These questions are to give the admissions committee an idea of how you handle moments of adversity or surprise, and how you learn from adverse or unexpected experiences. Before you begin writing, you should plan out your topic as thoroughly as you can so that the writing process can move smoothly. When trying to decide on a topic, think about any major challenges you’ve faced in life. Also consider any unexpected life events that may have turned out to be formative experiences. The prompt specifies that challenges and unexpected situations are both fair game, so don’t feel restricted to thinking only of negative experiences. Once you’ve thought about possible experiences you could write about, create a list of the challenges that came to mind and a separate list of unexpected situations. For each list, ask yourself which experiences taught you the most important or influential lessons about yourself or the world. Finally, after deciding on the best experience to talk about in this essay, ask yourself the following questions about it: What happened? In the moment, what was your reaction to the situation? How did it affect you, your thoughts, and your emotions? How have these emotions changed over time? Why was this experience so important to you? What is its personal significance? Consider the steps you took to manage the situation. Were they successful? Why or why not? Reflecting on the outcome of the event, how did the experience allow you to grow and mature as an individual? What did you learn from the success or failure of your approach? What lessons did you learn, both broadly and specifically? How did the experience prepare you to face occurrences like it in the future? How has it equipped you to adapt to different intercultural situations? Once you’ve chosen a topic and answered these questions, writing the essay shouldn’t be so daunting.",

Therefore, you should submit this essay, to help yourself stand out among the many other talented applicants trying to gain admission to Baylor.\n\nAt first glance, the prompt may look like one simple question, but we can further divide it into three smaller parts — and it’s important that you remember to address all three in your response.\n\nFirst Part: What are you looking for in a university?\nWhat we see is a pretty standard question that serves as the overarching theme of the whole college process. However, the challenge of answering this question comes largely from how general it is. Here, Baylor truly wants to know what you are looking for in your higher education experience. It’s important to keep in mind that you are just as much choosing a college as they are selecting the people that make up their community.\n\nYou should be genuine with what you are looking for, so whether that’s going to an institution that balances both research and religion or a school that competes in a Division I conference, you can include that in this essay. Once you have identified the key factors that drew you to consider Baylor in the first place, the next part of the prompt will be a lot easier to answer.\n\nSecond Part: Why do you want to attend Baylor University?\nIf you are applying to Baylor University, it should be true that you want to be in a noticeably religious environment, and that your past experiences and interests tie in with the mission of the college. Things to emphasize would be any community service or religious missions, if you’ve done them. This next question requires some research into the school, as they want to know why, out of other similar universities, Baylor is the one that stands out.\n\nOf course, while you are doing your research, make sure that you don’t simply repeat the information that you find. The aim of your answer is to include specific programs and resources that fit in with your profile. For example, if you enjoy working with local volunteer organizations, then you would mention how Baylor’s emphasis on service will help connect you with more opportunities for action. If gaining access to undergraduate research is important to you, you can also mention how the Baylor Undergraduate Research in Science and Technology organization will provide you with the support and access needed to get started as early as freshman year.\n\nAdditionally, Baylor offers many different programs and unique majors, such as the Honors Program that provides students with more in-depth classes and the guidance necessary to complete a senior thesis. While you don’t need to decide your major or involvements right now, it’s still good to look through the offerings and mention the things that caught your eye.\n\nThird Part: How do you see yourself contributing to the Baylor community?\nThis final piece is what we would consider the most important question. There is not “one right answer,” as it would be highly personal to each individual. The way to approach this is to be as specific with your involvements and passions as possible. Make sure however, that you can back up whatever you say with the rest of your application. You do not have to try and find something unique that you think would make you different if it’s not something that really represents who you are as a person.\n\nFor example, if you really enjoyed writing for your high school newspaper, then you could mention how you want to continue that passion by applying for a position on the Baylor Lariat, the university’s newspaper focusing on events happening both on and off campus. Whatever it is that you want to continue doing in college, try to find the corresponding club or organization within Baylor that you would join. Once again, this will help tie your individual goals with that of the university and show that you really spent time looking into them.",

This prompt wants to know about the material you consume outside of class to learn more about the topics you find interesting and relevant. The key to making this essay successful is picking the right book, so here are a few things to consider when choosing your selection: Who’s the author: It says it right in the prompt: “book by a living author”. As much as you might find one of Dickens’ novels fundamental to the human experience or Nelson Mandela’s autobiography to be a critical lesson on empathy, you can’t choose authors who are no longer alive. How familiar you are with the book: Pick a book you’ve either read recently or that was so impactful you can recall the plot and the deeper meaning of it. You’ll need to be confident about what you are writing, so it’s far better to pick a book that seems less “impressive” or “academic” on the surface that you know and love than a book you picked up last week for the purpose of writing this essay. Don’t be basic: There are many impactful books by talented authors in the cultural zeitgeist that will be popular choices for many students. You don’t want your essay to be the tenth one on The Handmaid’s Tale that admissions officers read that day. Try and pick something you wouldn’t be assigned in English class or that you wouldn’t find on New York Times bestseller lists. Make it align to you: The most important task when choosing a book is to make sure it relates to you in a way that you can highlight your interests or characteristics in the essay. Although the prompt might seem like it’s about a book, in reality, this essay is still about you. If you love politics, you might choose a politician’s autobiography or a book examining the state of democracy. A student interested in psychology could choose a dystopian novel and explore the psychological mechanisms at play in the society. Does it have a broad appeal?: Yes, your choice should relate to you, but it will also theoretically be read by the entire class, so it needs to have a broader appeal. Does your book highlight societal issues or have inspiring characters that everyone could learn a lesson from? Make sure you are able to demonstrate why this is a book everyone should read, not just people interested in the topic. Be judicious: Don’t pick the first book that comes to mind. Take your time in figuring out a list of 10 or so books you think could be good choices and then narrow it down from there. For each book, ask yourself questions like, “What is the core theme of this book?”, “How is society reflected in the ideas of this book?”, “How does this topic relate to me?”, and “Why do I find this author influential?”. Not only will this help you figure out which book speaks to you the most, it will also provide you with a solid basis to start planning out your essay once you choose a book. Once you’ve picked a book, it’s time to start writing. There are two main points you need to cover in your essay: why this book is meaningful to you and why it would be meaningful for your peers. Your essay needs to be centered around answering these two questions and convincing admissions officers, who might have never even heard of your book, that it has an impactful message. A natural way to approach your essay would be to open with a hook—maybe a quote from the book, an image of you snuggled up in your reading nook enjoying it for the first time, or a description of the frayed and browning edges and faded cover with a cracked spine from rereading it over and over—then discuss why this book is important to you, and finish with why other people should read it. Of course, you can change up the structure (creative formats are always welcome when it comes to college essays), but we will go into more detail based on the more traditional approach.",

Paint a picture for the reader: who are you talking to, how often do you talk, where are you located, was this a unique conversation or an example of a typical debate between you two? The more your essay reads like a page out of a novel, the better. You’ll definitely want to include lines of dialogue in this essay, but don’t let the entire thing read like a text message chain. Include supplemental details like you and your partners’ inflections, your body language as you were talking, and what was happening around you. For example, this isn’t revealing much to the admissions committee: “Mom?” “Yes honey?” “I got another C.” Versus this: “Mom?” A timid voice squeaked out the back of my throat, hoping to go undetected. My mom didn’t even bother to look up from the pile of papers sprawled out in front of her. “Yes honey?” She sounds busy—this can wait. I’ll just tell her tomorrow (or never). But something got the better of me and I sheepishly admitted the truth: “I got another C.” Beyond just the structure, it’s important to consider whom you will pick as your conversation partner. Remember, the prompt is looking for a particular conversation that challenged someone’s perspective, so don’t pick someone you always agree with. It should be someone you know well enough to recreate their side of the conversation—since you likely won’t remember what both of you said word for word. The conversation you choose can be as serious as challenging a family member’s prejudiced ways or as lighthearted as convincing your friends why Star Wars is better than Star Trek. For this essay, the topic is not as important as how you present the conversation. But how should you present it? A basic essay might rehash the language of the prompt, such as: “My favorite conversation partner is my dad, because he and I love music. Sometimes, we stay up late talking about different songs of his youth–old songs that I have never heard before. Oftentimes, he will reveal a hidden meaning behind the lyrics.” While this is answering the prompt, the response is formulaic and could be way more dynamic. Get creative! You could begin with a bold claim about your conversation partner, such as: “My father is a good but complicated man who, as of late, seems to only appear at night.” You could begin with a summary of what you talk about: “When I hear the opening power chords of the Eagles’ “The Last Resort,” I hear the voice of my father. It is important to note that my father is not Don Henley, merely a fan, yet his baritone voice narrates the hidden meaning of the lyrics, underscored by Schmit’s bass guitar.” Or with a strong statement: “It’s become an unspoken rule–a silent law–to never attempt to initiate a conversation with my father while he is listening to his music. We talk after an album or after a song ends. Monolithic grunts are the only acceptable verbal form of acknowledgement while listening, accompanied by a thumbs up, a fist pump through the silent air, or a mere upward curl of the lips, as if to say, ‘I like this one.’” After one of these strong beginnings, move into some dialogue and get to a point of conflict. We don’t mean physical conflict, rather where a disagreement in ideas is revealed that shows competing perspectives: “I don’t know Dad. The Eagles are fine but they’re no Led Zeppelin.” Uh oh, wrong move. My dad’s head swiveled like an owl eyeing its prey. I braced myself for the onslaught of song titles, Grammy nominations, and band drama headed my way. “You’re entitled to an opinion. Just not the wrong one.” The dangerous glint in his eye should’ve frightened me, but it only egged me on. “Seriously?! Stairway to Heaven is the ultimate rock song of the 70s.” “Ever heard of something called Hotel California?” His hands flailed in the air, expressing his point physically. Notice the effect of realistic dialogue and descriptions? The reader feels like they are standing on that porch watching this argument unfold. You want to draw the reader in with a conversation that feels natural and fitting for the people involved and the topic being discussed. The admissions committee don’t just want to see conflict, they want to see the way you handle new ideas and approach difficult conversations. This is where you have to demonstrate how either your perspective changed or you changed the other perspective. A nice conclusion to this essay should address you or your partner’s new perspective. Maybe you learned a lesson from how you handled disagreement. Or maybe you are looking forward to your next conversation where you can prove your point once again.",

Discuss a time when someone defined you by a single story. What challenges did this present and how did you overcome them?",
        "word_limit": "400",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt option is similar to a “Diversity” prompt, but you aren’t limited to just discussing racial and ethnic diversity. Anyone who has been stereotyped or judged for something outside of their control before could write a compelling essay to answer this question. Here are a few ideas of possible essays students could write about in response to the prompt: A student faced microaggressions because of the color of his skin. People assumed a student was LGBTQ+ because they were part of the theater club at their school. A girl who was called a dumb blonde felt discouraged to answer questions in her math class. A boy’s teachers assumed he would excel because his older brother was at the top of his class. A student was subjected to harmful stereotypes because of their religion. As you can see, there are many different avenues to take when answering this prompt. The important thing is to describe how you were defined by a single story, show the impact that had on you, and demonstrate how you overcame or fought back against your single story. The best way to start this essay is with an anecdote. Place the reader in your shoes so we can understand what you went through. The key is to show the reader with vivid imagery: “Adios mama.” I hung up and slipped my phone back into my bag, only to be greeted by three sneering faces when I looked up again. ‘Hablasss inglesss?’ Their American accents and teasing tone drew out the words so they were barely recognizable to a native Spanish speaker. ‘Tu estás en los Estados Unidos.’ Another boy chimed in over his friends’ snickers. Once you’ve established the discrimination you’ve experienced, explain the impact that had on you. Did it mess with your performance in school because you were afraid to be criticized for your accent when you answered a question? Did you feel insecure about your looks and that made you try new hairstyles and outfits until you barely recognized yourself anymore? Did you stop participating in an activity you loved and feel unfulfilled? It’s really important to go a step beyond the comments and treatments you received from others and explore how you were emotionally and mentally impacted by being siloed into a single story. This is where the depth of your essay will come from and what will distinguish it as either strong or weak. While this essay does handle challenging topics, it’s not meant to be a depressing recount of discrimination you’ve faced; it’s meant to demonstrate your resilience and ability to overcome a difficult situation. Save at least half of your essay to tell the story of how you fought back and overcame the challenges of being assigned a single story. Be as detailed as possible when discussing how you overcame your single story. The admissions committee is curious to see your methods (did you ignore and rise above the comments or talk back and deny them) and your thought processes (what was your motivation behind standing up for yourself, was there a final straw that pushed you over the edge, did you turn to others for advice, etc). Finally, it’s a good idea to include self-reflection in this type of essay. Consider some of these questions to guide your reflection: How is your unique background an asset? How has your personality been shaped by your experiences? Are you still fighting being assigned a single story? How can you prevent this from happening in the future? By reflecting on your diversity, you will demonstrate your ability to think critically and show the admissions committee the unique perspective you’ll bring to the school.",

        "word_limit": "400",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is a combination of the “Global Issues” and “Why This College?” essay archetypes. You need to both address a societal issue that is important to you and discuss how the tools and resources at BC will help you solve it. But don’t fret—you can get it all done in 400 words. You’ll likely want to pick this option if you are civically minded, have experience volunteering or participating in political extracurriculars, or if you are interested in pursuing something in the realm of politics. Here are the steps we recommend to help you write this essay. Pick an Issue: The first place to start when brainstorming for this topic is to pick an issue that is near and dear to you. Ideally, this should be something you either have prior experience with from an extracurricular or volunteer work, or it should be a topic that affects you or your community that you can speak extensively about. Avoid choosing an issue as broad as climate change or world hunger. Instead, narrow these down into more manageable issues like rising sea levels or food deserts in rural communities. By staying focused on a sub-issue, you can really delve into the causes and solutions for that particular topic—resulting in a more cohesive and engaging essay. Explain Your Connection to the Issue: This part of the essay is incredibly important; it’s basically the “so what?” for why you care about this topic and others should too. It’s a good idea to include an anecdote to demonstrate how you have experienced this issue in your life. For example, a student who is writing about high incarceration rates in the U.S. might write about friends and community members who have been incarcerated and how angry that made them feel. Another student might choose to write about the issue of deforestation and how he’s been volunteering to plant trees since he was 12 to try and combat the issue. Whatever your connection is to the topic, make sure that your response covers the personal impact the issue has on you. In the case of the student writing about incarceration, they should definitely describe how members of their community have been affected, but this is their college essay, so we want to know how they have been affected. How do they feel knowing their community is being ravaged by this issue? What did it feel like to lose a friend to the justice system for a crime they didn’t commit? By highlighting the personal effects, you will make your essay stand out. How Have You Addressed This Issue Already: Since you are picking a local or global issue that is in some way relevant to your life, chances are you’ve probably already taken some action to try and find solutions. Show the admissions committee that you are a driven individual who’s committed to doing good through your past actions. Include how you collect old computer parts and repurpose them in your repair business to cut down on technological waste. Explain how you organized donation drives at your school and church to collect essentials for Ukrainian refugees. Demonstrate your commitment to improving female literacy through your work as a volunteer tutor at a local children’s center. Discuss BC Resources: This is where the “Why This College” part of the essay comes into play, and since BC doesn’t give you another opportunity to explain what specific programs and resources appeal to you, make sure to highlight that in this essay. Here are a few things to keep in mind when discussing college-specific resources: Do your research: It only takes a bit of your time to look up the special programs, classes, professors, and clubs offered at a school, but it makes a world of difference in making your essay stand out. Demonstrate your interest to the admissions committee by including details you could only find on a specific webpage or by attending an info session. Don’t namedrop: Saying you want to work with X Professor or take these three classes is meaningless if we don’t know why. When you are including the names of school-specific opportunities, back it up with details. Connect the resources back to you: How does this professor’s research relate to your interests? How will working in this lab help you get closer to your goals? Make sure that every school opportunity you discuss is tied back to you in some way. Less is more: It’s far more effective to find three or four resources at the school that align perfectly with your interests and you can thoroughly explain rather than squeezing five or more in without giving any explanation to their importance. The resources that you pick should align in some way to the issue you discussed. For instance, if the topic you want to address is the Black Lives Matter movement, it would be a good idea to say something like, “The Comparative Social Movements class will help me understand the tactics past movements used to succeed, while helping Professor McGuffey with his research on race, gender, and sex will help me better understand the ways intersectionality defines the Black experience.” Wrapping It Up: For an essay about addressing a societal issue, you’ll want to end on a positive note. Show admissions officers that you are forward-thinking and know exactly how you can solve a pressing issue with the resources BC has to offer.",

What societal problems are important to you and how will you use your HCE education to solve them?",
        "word_limit": "400",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "In this essay, your primary goal is to explain how you will use Boston College’s engineering education to “serve the Common Good” (i.e. address issues in society). In essence, this prompt is a variation on the “Why This College/Program?” essay. One important piece of advice is to remember that this essay is about you and the program. Don’t just name aspects of the program you’re excited about; make sure you tie them into your story, values, aspirations, or other qualities. There’s a lot to consider in this essay, but don’t be intimidated! Dedicating a healthy amount of time to brainstorming and planning will make your essay much stronger. Before you begin to tackle this multifaceted prompt, remember that the structure of your essay doesn’t have to mirror the order in which you brainstorm. Start by familiarizing yourself with the goals and requirements of the program. Boston College’s Human-Centered Engineering program is a brand-new, interdisciplinary program that gives students a strong foundation in the liberal arts and rigorously prepares them to engineer solutions to global problems. It requires 120 credits, two-thirds of which must be STEM-focused, and one-third of which must be in the liberal arts and humanities. You can read more about the program on the BC website. During the brainstorming stage, pick several specific features of the program that catch your interest: perhaps the idea of working with stakeholder groups on design solutions appeals to your creative quest to solve real-world problems. Or, maybe the idea of a weekly reflection on the ethics of engineering strikes you as an important practice for keeping yourself accountable to a humanistic perspective. You’ll come back to these components of the program once you’ve identified a central problem around which to base your essay. Next, think about your goals in conjunction with engineering–this is the first stage of framing that central problem for your essay. Why are you interested in engineering, from a human-impact perspective? What broad human issues do you find most urgent? Although the prompt doesn’t ask you to pick just one societal challenge or opportunity to address in your essay, we advise you to choose one central theme around which to base your essay. Boston College’s Human-Centered Engineering program aims to put human concerns at the center of its training. To get a better understanding of the program’s objectives, it can help to consider what this program strives not to be (and, by extension, what you should focus on avoiding or going beyond in your essay). One page on the Human-Centered Engineering website highlights a couple of contrasting concepts on engineering’s objectives: “The engineers of the future will be asked to do more than build bridges. We’re educating innovative thinkers whose broad knowledge and passion for helping others will set them apart in whatever career they pursue.” Boston College’s engineering program strives to get at issues that have a greater human impact than functional design. “This is not engineering for engineering’s sake—this is engineering for impact.” As a graduate of the program, you’re not just inheriting engineering endeavors passed down for generations. You’re innovating and creating solutions to problems that today’s engineers might not yet know how to approach–hence the emphasis on creativity and humanistic perspective. At this point, you should identify a pressing global or community-based human problem you’d like to address. This should be the focus of your brainstorming efforts. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a problem to discuss: Personal impact. Your essay will be much more cohesive and strong if you choose a topic that has affected you or a community you’re part of. For example, if your family owned a farm in Texas, where droughts are a recurring issue, you might be passionate about finding engineering solutions to the issue of water conservation. By framing the global issue of water shortage around your family’s experience, you can more effectively argue for the human impact of the issue. Breadth. You should choose an example that is broad enough to fall into the category of “societal challenge,” but not too broad. If you choose an example that is too broad or vague, like “world peace,” you will come across as out of touch with the goals of the program. If your first thought was world peace, or some other broad human problem, don’t despair, though! Focus on finding a more specific concern within that broad context. In the case of world peace, think about a concrete problem that causes wars and disputes between human communities. Maybe it’s access to the internet. Then you can frame this issue as worldwide connectivity and access to technology. You don’t need to know all the details of your solution’s mechanism–that’s the purpose of your education–but your central problem should lend itself to an interdisciplinary, engineering-based solution. Current Global Crises. The Human-Centered Engineering website gives you a few ideas for relevant human problems: environment (their example being access to clean water), health (with exposure to air pollution as an example), and energy (exemplified by a shift to renewable energy). It would be a good idea to choose a more specific concern within one of these sectors, but if you have a great idea that isn’t related to any of these ideas, that’s okay! The more creative and specific your idea, the better. Once you’ve chosen a central problem, go back to the concrete aspects of the Boston College’s program that you found most noteworthy. How can these features support your goals? You will probably need to go back to the program website and find some more specific resources that will help you achieve your goals. Let’s take access to technology and connectivity as our example. You might point out that the liberal arts core will help you gain empathy and perspective on the issue; there is an abundance of literature and psychological studies on the ways in which being left behind technologically creates tensions and war. You might also argue that the weekly ethical reflections will help you consider the human needs that you can address within the issue of access to technology–why should we endeavor to bring up-to-date technology across the globe? Lastly, the design-thinking modules with stakeholders will help you learn to work with affected parties to create reliable solutions, and this ability to work with stakeholders means you can customize access to technology based on location and connectivity needs. Note that the prompt mentions how the program “strives to develop people who will integrate technical knowledge, creativity, and a humanistic perspective” to societal problems. Make sure you address how the program will help you develop each of these qualities when it comes to addressing the societal problem you’ve chosen.",

The prompt also asks you to reflect on how you’ve actively approached these issues and advocated for their resolution (or even attempted to solve them!). To help you brainstorm about ongoing societal or community issues, ask yourself: What existing problems in my immediate community do I find personally and particularly frustrating? What issues have I taken a lead role in engaging with? How have I served my community? Have I been involved in any advocacy programs or campaigns in my community?

Note, the second half of this prompt is new this year—it asks how you plan to contribute to the BU campus community. Be sure to address this half of the prompt by explaining how your personal values and interests align with BU. Discuss how you hope to showcase these values and interests in BU’s lively community. If you’ve visited the campus or have attended a summer program at the University, you should definitely note that in the essay. Include sensory details and specific moments, whether it was visiting the halls that Dr. Martin Luther King once studied in, lying down on “BU Beach” and catching the breeze, or simply sitting outside of Marsh Chapel and observing the great diversity on campus as people walked along Commonwealth Avenue.

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Brandeis prides itself on its foundation as an institution that has promoted inclusivity since day one, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that their essay question is centered around diversity and inclusion. Before you begin writing, it’s important to understand the prompt fully. There are two key things to take notice of: The first thing is 'your educational experience.' This means that you need to draw from your own personal experiences to answer the prompt. It shouldn’t be an English-class style essay picking apart different perspectives on justice—you need to use your own lived experiences to support your opinions. The second thing is how the prompt specifically asks for 'educational' experience. Don’t make the mistake of limiting yourself to only experiences in the classroom—educational experiences can take the form of independent research, books, academic extracurriculars, conferences and contests, volunteer work, summer programs, and more. The other notable phrase in the prompt is 'your perspective.' This goes back to the aforementioned idea that you need to draw on your personal experiences to explain your position on the topic of inclusion. Admissions officers don’t want to hear about the dictionary definition of inclusion or how an acclaimed civil rights activist viewed it. They want to hear directly from you. In this sense, the essay can be thought of like an English-class essay because you are required to take a stance on what values like diversity, inclusion, and justice mean to you, and to support your opinion with evidence from your own experience. While some students might find it easy to think of an example where they encountered or overcame antisemitism, racism, sexism, homophobia, or xenophobia, other students might not have a personal story come to mind so quickly. However, this essay isn’t optional and for many students it’s the only opportunity for Brandeis to hear their voice directly, so you’ll need to come up with something. Even if you aren’t directly related to such a situation, think about a time you witnessed the harmful effects of discrimination or the positive effects of inclusion. By engaging in a brainstorming exercise to recall moments involving the topics of the essay, you’ll hopefully be able to trigger memories that are more meaningful to you. If you still have nothing that directly involves you, it’s okay to use a story where you were on the periphery—just compensate for your lack of action in the example with extensive reflection on the situation. Remember, your educational experience could be in the form of a debate you participated in on the effects of public housing policy on exacerbating racial discrimination, or a book you read about the psychological dynamics behind mass genocides—it doesn’t necessarily have to be a physical interaction you had with others. As long as you communicate that you’ve had some academic exposure that has influenced your perspective, you can choose just about any educational experience to support your essay. We can’t really tell you how to write about your perspective on Brandeis’s core values because your perspective has to come from you! However, we can give you some tips to keep in mind and things to emphasize in your essay. Don’t lie about your opinion. There is no one right or wrong way to approach the nuances of inclusion and justice. Obviously, you should regard inclusion as a good thing—Brandeis doesn’t want to admit closed-minded or prejudiced students—but your take on it could vary from others. Be authentic and true to your beliefs; believe us, it’s easier to tell when someone is lying in an essay than you might think. Tie your perspective to the experience you discuss. For example, a student who attended a summer program in another country and experienced what it felt like to be welcomed by people from other cultural backgrounds should share that she thinks inclusion is critical to forming relationships that otherwise wouldn’t occur. It wouldn’t make sense for her to write about her experience and then talk about her views on why religious tolerance is important. Make sure there is a natural logical thread running through your essay. It’s better to be more focused. You aren’t expected to provide a dissertation on the importance of all types of inclusion in just 250 words. Home in on a particular issue you feel strongly about that also relates to your experiences. The more focused your topic is, the more detail you can provide and the more your genuine passion for what you’re saying will shine through. Highlight how you personally embody the values. Going beyond the experiences that shaped your perspective, demonstrate to the admissions committee that you live by values of justice and inclusion. Explain how simple choices in your life are guided by these values or share how you’ve grown from embracing these values. This will show how ingrained Brandeis’s core values are in you, making you shine as an applicant. If you have the space at the end of your essay, a nice way to conclude is to explain how you will carry these guiding principles with you to Brandeis. Go deeper than a generic response that says something like, 'I will continue to prioritize inclusive communities as a Brandeis student.' Instead, aim for something more descriptive like, 'Whether it’s prioritizing minority voices in articles I write for The Justice or inviting all my hallmates to the weekly floor dinners I’ll cook, I’ll strive to make every student feel welcome.'",

        "prompt_text": "What excites you the most about being an international student at Brandeis University?",
        "word_limit": "250 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Essentially, this prompt is asking, 'Why do you want to attend Brandeis as an international student?' Brandeis prides itself on its diversity and wants to continue enriching its campus culture with different perspectives. As an international student, your admissions reader wants to know why you most want to be a part of that community and to bring your perspectives to Brandeis. In other words, this is essentially a standard 'Why This College' prompt with an international twist, meaning a lot of the same advice applies. Before answering this prompt, you need to do your research. Read up on the major you’re planning to pursue, learn about student organizations that exist on campus, look into research opportunities, and figure out how you can get involved in campus life. Whichever angle you choose for your response, make sure to reference something specific to Brandeis, whether that’s a club you are eager to join, an accelerated BA/MA business program that perfectly suits your academic goals, or the University’s commitment to volunteering and tracking service hours that inspires you. When it comes to planning your response—a brief 250 words total—you need to first realize that the question does not simply ask why you want to attend Brandeis, but what makes you most excited to be there. Think about how your life experiences so far can contribute to the overall Brandeis community and how you feel like your perspective will be represented on campus. For example, if you are pursuing International and Global Studies, you can write about having lived abroad in the regions you will be discussing in class. You can share that you feel as though you can provide a firsthand perspective on how locals view the issues in question and that you know that perspective has a place at Brandeis, which places a lot of emphasis on International Studies, both domestically and abroad. Continuing the above example, you might also write about how Brandeis would provide you with a home base to conduct your studies of globalization, and that the importance that Brandeis places on interning and studying internationally would allow you to continue your understanding of the globe. If you are planning to work toward the accelerated BA/MA business degree that Brandeis offers, for example, you can discuss your country of origin’s economic system and fundamental financial practices, and describe how learning about the American market at Brandeis through such a specialized program would give you important insight that your peers at home may not have. Or, if you are a future Studio Art or Theatre Major, you can share how you’re excited to share your country’s folklore through the art you complete in the program. You can get specific about what your country’s culture, art, or history may look like, as well as note exactly which programs you’re excited to participate in. For instance, you can write about how you’re excited to showcase your work in Brandeis’s 10-day Festival of Creative Arts, and to bring your culture to an American audience. What you’re most excited about may be outside the classroom! Spend some time perusing the extracurricular offerings at Brandeis. And remember, don’t just name-drop—do thorough research on these organizations and write about why they excite you. Consider the following example: Perhaps you were heavily involved in your local women’s rights advocacy club back in high school in Taiwan. Write about the challenges you faced in trying to change the perception of women as homemakers that is ingrained in the local culture and how you addressed them. Then detail how Brandeis offers a plethora of opportunities to continue helping women, such as Brandeis’s chapter of the Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance, and the International Business Women Leadership and Networking group. If religion and spirituality are important to you, see if you can find an organization that practices your faith. Talk about the way your religion’s practices vary from country to country, and the specificities that your country brings to worship. Tell the admissions committee how you’re excited to foster a better understanding of your belief system among your peers. Alternatively, if you find that your faith is not well represented at Brandeis, tell the admissions committee how Brandeis’s spirit of diversity and inclusivity makes you excited to bring your religion to its campus. Talk about how you might start your own religious student organization to bring together a new community of people and to educate the rest of the student body about your beliefs. Brandeis sports a variety of cultural societies, from the German Club to the Taiwanese Student Association. Do other students who hail from your country of origin have a place to come together and promote their culture? If not, think about creating such a space! You can frame your aspirations in terms of multicultural understanding and dialogue, and share some ideas you may have for spreading your culture on campus—whether it be through film screenings, dinners, or anything else that strikes your fancy. Perhaps you come from a country where journalists are marginalized and free press is stifled. You may wish to join a media organization on campus to let your voice be heard and to advocate for the continued protection of free speech in the United States. You can write about how you’re excited to share your perspectives with your classmates and to discuss the importance of giving everyone an opportunity to voice their opinions and beliefs by grounding the discussion in your own experiences at home. Although you don’t have a lot of room in your response, don’t be afraid to combine the various academic and extracurricular excitements you have to form one cohesive essay. Just remember to ground your response in the unique perspective that your origins will allow you to share with other students!",

        "word_limit": "250 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is asking you to reflect on two things: the personal strengths you can contribute to a peer group and the ways in which you could draw on your peers’ strengths. In addition to your collaboration skills, admissions officers will be assessing your self-awareness: they want to see how well you understand your unique strengths and weaknesses. Specificity: Clearly identify your strengths and how they will benefit the group. Avoid vague statements like 'I’m a hard worker.' Instead, choose traits that will be more specific to you, and provide examples or context, to concretely show how your strengths have made a difference in the past. Self-Awareness: Demonstrate a deep understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, so that admissions officers can see you’re both already mature and willing to keep growing. Balance: Discuss both your strengths and the areas where you see yourself learning from others in college. Showing that you value both giving and receiving in a group is crucial. Contribution to the Group: Emphasize how your strengths will enhance the college experience of everyone in the group, not just yourself. Growth Mindset: Show that you are eager to learn from others and grow in areas where you might be weaker. You want to come across as adaptable and open to new experiences. Good Example: 'One of my greatest strengths is my ability to bring people together through empathetic leadership and active listening. In high school, I was the captain of the debate team, where I often mediated conflicts between team members who had different approaches to preparation. By taking the time to understand each person’s perspective and facilitating open discussions, I helped create an environment where everyone felt valued and motivated, and as we became more supportive of each other, our performances also improved. I’m excited to bring this collaborative spirit to our cohort, by fostering an inclusive atmosphere–perhaps even through informal, fun debates about things like Taylor Swift’s best era–where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas. However, I sometimes struggle with overcommitting myself, especially when I’m passionate about multiple projects. I’ve always been someone who wants to be involved in everything, from volunteering to organizing events, but this instinct can lead to poor prioritization of tasks, and eventually burnout. I admire peers who have mastered the art of balance and time management, and I’m eager to learn from them, so that I can contribute to our group without spreading myself too thin, as I’ll be able to dedicate myself fully to each task. By mediating even minor conflicts and refining my organization skills, I can help build both a close community within our cohort, and a better structure for my own life in college.' Bad Example: 'I believe my main strength is that I am a hard worker. Throughout high school, I’ve always put in the effort to get good grades, even in subjects I find challenging, like math and science. I’m confident that my work ethic will help me succeed in college, and I’m eager to bring this dedication to the group. I always make sure to finish my assignments on time and try to help others when they’re struggling. However, I sometimes find it hard to collaborate with others. I tend to work better alone because I like to do things my own way, and I sometimes get frustrated when others don’t meet my standards. But I know that I need to work on this, and I hope to learn how to be more patient and open-minded by interacting with people who are more easygoing. Overall, I think my strong work ethic will be an asset to the group, and I’m hoping to improve my collaboration skills and become more comfortable in social situations by learning from my peers.'",

        "word_limit": "250-500",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is a version of the diversity essay archetype. Generally, this kind of prompt seeks to know more about your personal background and its impact on your worldview. Here, though, the prompt is a bit more nuanced, in that it doesn’t specifically ask about personal identities or differences, and instead focuses on your most authentic self. The most authentic parts of yourself are the most significant: the ones that have the most impact on who you are and how you exist in the world. This prompt is not directly asking what about you is unique, but in asking to know about the most authentic parts of your personality and background, you’ll likely end up talking about aspects of yourself that make you, you, as opposed to someone else. With this prompt, it’s important to remember that 'diversity' does not automatically equate to a cultural, ethnic, or racial background (although these can still be great topics). There are many other aspects of identity that contribute to a diverse, or authentic, campus, including socioeconomic classes, hometowns, illnesses and disabilities, or even interests and hobbies. Any dimension of yourself and your identity can be the focus of a great response to this question, as long as it’s significant, and emphasizes authenticity and personal truth. A quick note, though: In June 2023, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling, however, still allows colleges to consider race or ethnicity on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts as one of their supplemental essay prompts. If you feel that your racial or ethnic background has impacted you significantly, this is the place to discuss that, as otherwise, Bryn Mawr admissions officers will have no way to factor it in. If you want to highlight something other than your race or ethnicity, when brainstorming a topic, think about your core values and personal beliefs. Consider how these truths came to be for you, and how they’ve influenced your actions, choices, and relationships. Then, apply the answers to these questions to Bryn Mawr’s own values and campus community. How do they overlap? Tie your personal truths, ambitions, and interests to what you know about Bryn Mawr, both academically and personally. Since this supplement is on the longer side, you have the room to explore 2-3 different traits if you want to, but don’t spread yourself too thin – describing one trait well is much better than describing 3 poorly. Remember, authenticity is the priority here – it’s the key word of the prompt. Avoid clichés or trying to impress admissions officers with a forced or exaggerated truth. Instead, focus on a belief or realization that truly resonates with you. Be specific, and go beyond surface-level reflection. The 'why' behind this truth and its impact on your life should be the bulk of your essay. Rather than simply stating 'this is an important part of who I am,' show readers how you developed this trait, and why it matters for understanding what kind of college student you’ll be. Make sure to connect your essay to Bryn Mawr, by demonstrating how this realization might shape your experience at this particular college, or impact your involvement within their campus community. (However, if you plan to respond to the second prompt as well – and you should – you’ll reflect plenty about your place on the Bryn Mawr campus there, so keep this connection limited to how it specifically relates to the personal truth you’re focusing on here.)",

In college applications, your opportunities to share your personality are already limited, so you don’t want to voluntarily limit yourself even further by letting this prompt pass you by. Take advantage of the chance to tell Bryn Mawr admissions officers why you’re applying to their school! Before you begin brainstorming for your response, we recommend taking a look at our general post on 'Why School?' supplements, if you haven’t already. Remember, however, that even if you have already responded to a 'Why School?' supplement, you shouldn’t just copy and paste Bryn Mawr into that template. While you will likely end up using some elements from that other essay, each school has different values and opportunities, so you should approach each 'Why School?' prompt as a different essay. As you begin drafting your response, there are two things you want to keep in mind. First, the reasons you want to go to Bryn Mawr should be specific, and truly unique to Bryn Mawr. Second, those reasons should clearly connect to you and your goals for college. To identify opportunities that are unique to Bryn Mawr, you’ll have to do some research. Clubs, course offerings, and study abroad programs are some good starting points. Once you have identified some things you’re interested in, make sure you explain to your reader why you’re interested in these particular opportunities. You want to paint a picture of how you would fit into the Bryn Mawr community – if you just list the opportunities without connecting them to you, your response may end up sounding more like a brochure than a college essay.

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a straightforward “Why this major?” essay. To begin your essay, you should explain why you’re interested in pursuing the field(s) you’ve chosen. For example: A student interested in a career in medicine might want to double major in biology and sociology to gain a better grasp of both the science and the interpersonal aspects of healthcare. A student dedicated to protecting the environment because they grew up camping regularly might want to major in environmental engineering to combine their love of math with their passion for environmental preservation. Someone who sought to be a young entrepreneur, whether through lemonade stands or something larger-scale like a local business, could be interested in the Markets, Innovation & Design major to help them develop into stronger businesspeople. It’s also perfectly acceptable to choose two majors for two totally different reasons—maybe you want to major in computer science for career preparation, but have a second major in Art History simply because it’s a subject you enjoy. If you are applying as an undecided student, it’s important that your reason for being undecided isn’t 'I just don’t know.' Think about why you haven’t settled on the one field that really captivates you. Try not to say anything that could have any negative connotations—like that all of your school subjects bore you, or that nothing has interested you enough for you to try very hard. However, there are several positive ways you can frame your choice to apply undecided: Perhaps your diverse passions—ranging from art to natural sciences to engineering—have made it difficult for you to choose just one or two specific fields to pursue in college. Maybe you grew up in an environment where you did not have the opportunity to explore many different academic fields, and entering college undecided gives you the freedom to try new things—like neuroscience or anthropology. Think about how you can best frame your 'undecided' status in a way that still demonstrates your passion for learning and shares a couple fields you might explore. When you start writing, be concise with your language. Avoid explicitly stating 'I am interested in this major because…' Even though that’s a very clear statement, it’s not very compelling writing. You only have 250 words to show admissions officers that you’re really, genuinely captivated by your choice in major. Dive right into descriptions and details so that your readers can see why you’ve chosen to pursue it—or why you haven’t decided yet! The second component of this prompt is why you chose this field of study at this particular school. It is important to include elements specific to Bucknell in your essay, which means you will need to do some research. We recommend the school’s website as a great starting point. Bucknell has a site dedicated to Majors & Minors and you can see the requirements for any prospective field of study. This will allow you to apply the existing framework to your own life, in order to craft a more compelling narrative. Here are two examples: Bad: 'I am interested in Bucknell’s opportunities for biology majors, such as summer research programs and a small class size. I think that Bucknell stands out from other universities because it has a hands-on research program. By studying in the field, I can accrue the crucial skills I need to succeed in my future career.' Good: 'It’s common for kids to collect pretty rocks, but I took collecting rocks to the next level—I would attempt to classify my specimens into the three basic rock types, and identify the exact name of the rocks through my massive rock encyclopedia. I solidified my love of earth sciences when I took my first formal geology course my freshman year. Since there was no higher-level geology course beyond that, I was inspired to start my own club, where we would go on hikes in the Berkshires to collect soil samples and study the different rock formations. I look forward to further developing my geosciences knowledge at Bucknell, in the Geology & Environmental Geosciences Department. I’m especially looking forward to widening my repertoire by taking courses such as Stream Restoration and Geology for Engineers. I want to use what I learn to help preserve and protect our environment and its countless years of history.' The former response lacks the specificity and depth of the latter, making it pale in comparison. A well-researched response rooted in your personal interests shows that you’re genuinely invested in attending Bucknell and are a strong fit—this is what you should be aiming for.",

Being able to express your openness to engage with people who have different backgrounds, ideologies, or opinions is an important quality you want your essay to possess. It might seem daunting to pick one person to center your college essay around. Hopefully, these questions can help ground you and narrow down your decision. Who is someone in your life that has a different background, belief system, or personality from yours? How did you first meet or get to know this person? What are some key differences between you and this person? How do those differences impact your relationship? What have you learned from this person that you might not have learned from someone more similar to you? How has your relationship with this person influenced your views, values, or behaviors? What specific moments or interactions with this person stand out to you as particularly meaningful? How do you think your relationship with this person will continue to impact you in the future? There are a few things to keep in mind as you approach this prompt to make sure it impresses the Carleton admissions officers, rather than boring them with the same cookie-cutter response. First off, be as specific as possible in your essay. Pick a singular example to show, rather than tell, how you differ from the person you choose. Make it clear exactly what you get out of your interactions, as well as why the interactions are meaningful to you. Another thing good responses will highlight is the student’s personal growth. Carleton wants to see that you are open to learning from those who are different from you, not that you merely interact with them. Also remember to keep the focus of your essay on how your differences have made you (and even the other person) stronger. While it’s important to discuss the differences that exist, you want to make sure you drive home the point that there is a deeper meaning to your interaction.",

However, if you feel as though there is something about your identity or about why you want to go to Carleton that is important to your application and hasn’t yet been addressed, don’t hesitate to include it here. Here are some examples of details you may wish to write about here: Unusual circumstances or hardships (financial hardships, first-generation status, illness, tragedy, etc.); Family responsibilities that may have prevented students from taking traditional extracurriculars; Unique extracurricular that wasn’t written about in another part of the application outside of the Activities section; Describing your identity in the context of race, gender, or sexuality.

Also, even though this prompt has a 250-word limit, feel free to only write a few short sentences if that feels more appropriate to you.

Incorporating anecdotes into this essay will help you show, not tell, the admissions committee why you are interested in your chosen field. 3. Mention your commitment.

You need to demonstrate the benefits you personally see in a diverse group, and the best way to do that is to use your previous life experiences. While this isn’t a typical diversity essay, you might find some of the tips in this CollegeVine guide helpful. Although the prompt lists a variety of 'traditional' types of diversity, it isn’t an exhaustive list. Diversity can also come in the form of a hobby, a club you’re in, or a unique perspective you have from your lived experiences. Think of a time when you were part of a community of diverse people or one with diverse perspectives and use that to guide your writing. For example, a student might write about how kids on her soccer team were from a variety of different countries. While the Women’s World Cup was happening, everyone rooted for a different team, but rather than ignoring the other countries, the whole soccer team would watch each match with equal excitement. Through the process of watching other countries play, they picked up on new moves and strategies that they then brought to their own soccer team. As you can see from the two examples, diversity can come in all shapes and sizes, and your previous experiences with diversity can vary greatly. However, it isn’t enough to just share an example of how you’ve engaged with diversity before. You also need to explain your view of the benefits of diversity. The above examples touch on more of the tangible benefits (learning new soccer moves and winning a quiz bowl), but the more impactful benefits are internal or emotional. You should conclude your essay by explaining how you will apply the lessons you learned at Colgate. Perhaps you’re now more willing to take a class in a subject you’ve never engaged with before, or maybe you’re going to join a club where you can engage in open dialogue with people from many different backgrounds. Your explanation should be personal and should relate to the benefits you identified from your experiences.",

Explain your passion and where it came from. 2. Demonstrate how you will pursue your passion in college. 3. Share your future goals related to your passion. You don’t have a lot of space to accomplish all three of these things, so let’s dive deeper into each step to make sure you know exactly what to do. It’s a safe assumption that you will pick a major that relates to your interests. It’s also okay to not know what you want to study in college yet, and in that case you should take a look at CollegeVine’s guide to writing a 'Why This Major' essay if you’re undecided. While your interest in a subject is obvious to you, it isn’t to the admissions committee reading your essay, so you need to show them what you are interested in. And what’s the best way to do that? Anecdotes! The most exciting essays often come from students who can craft a story that places the reader in the moment when the student successfully coded their first iPhone game, or a story that makes the reader feel like they’re sitting next to the student intensely researching the ethics of biomedical engineering. You should spend about 100-150 words on this portion of the essay. Since this section sets the tone of the essay and is the place where you can talk about yourself, don’t rush it. However, remember that you still need space to connect your passion to Colgate, so don’t waste the limited space on an overly descriptive anecdote. The second half of your essay will bring Colgate into the picture. Be careful—this is where many students fall short because they aren’t specific enough. The key to describing how you will pursue your interests in college is to be as specific as possible. Bring in unique academic and extracurricular resources you can only find at Colgate to demonstrate not only that this is the perfect topic for you to study, but also that Colgate is the perfect place for you to do so. Remember: quality over quantity! It’s much better to have two or three resources you connect with than it is to name-drop a dozen things you want to be a part of. Even students who pick unique, school-specific offerings can still have essays that are just okay, and that’s because they forget to connect the offering back to themselves. Whether you’re talking about how your previous work relates to a professor’s research, or how the skills in a class will be useful to you when you create your own product one day, you need to provide an explanation about why this resource stands out to you. The final thing to include in your essay is an explanation of your career goals and aspirations. This is where you let the admissions officers know all the great things you plan on accomplishing one day so they feel like they have to have you as a successful alum.",

Each sentence starter allows you to tell the admissions committee a lot about yourself, but there is very little space to elaborate. As you figure out what you want to say, be honest in your responses and be thoughtful with how you use your limited word count. Also remember that there’s no need to repeat the beginning of the sentence. Here are short breakdowns on how to approach each prompt: 1. I am fascinated by… Be mindful that your response isn’t redundant with what you say elsewhere in your application. If you’ve already said you want to major in anthropology, you don’t want to use this sentence starter to repeat your interest in that same subject. Instead, use this opportunity to share new information. 2. My favorite book, movie, or television show is… Here, the most important thing is to be honest. If you hated Pride and Prejudice, don’t say it’s your favorite book just because it’s famous. On the other hand, many people have a lot of books and films they like, and picking just one can be hard. We recommend choosing one that illustrates a particular quality you want to share with the admissions committee. 3. The person I admire most is… As with the book question, you want to be honest, while also choosing a name that reveals something important about you. 4. In the future, I hope to… This may be an intimidating question, as you likely have no idea what you’ll be doing even one year after college, never mind far in the future. Remember that you aren’t committing yourself to anything here. 5. One historical figure I would like to meet is… You don’t have to be a history major to come up with a good answer to this question—just about any person from history can work for this answer. 6. My favorite food is… For this response, it’s all about the imagery and the story you can craft to demonstrate why you love this food. 7. One thing I would change is… You want to think about changes that show your reader how you view the world. 8. My favorite place is… Similar to the favorite food question, it’s all about the story and imagery you conjure up when describing your favorite place. 9. I am the best version of myself when… Your goal here should be to not just list your best qualities, but also demonstrate self-awareness of when those qualities come out. 10. Something that has changed my perspective is… Think back on an event or situation that opened your eyes to a new world view. 11. I am seeking a community that… In (briefly) describing the environment where you feel you’ll thrive, you’ll ideally also want to touch on Colgate’s own values. 12. My favorite family/community/cultural tradition is… Your goal should be to get truly personal and reflective on why this tradition is significant to you. 13. I am drawn to Colgate University because… It’s hard to boil down an entire 'Why This College' essay into 13 words, but you can do it!",

        "word_limit": "100 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a classic 'Why This College' essay prompt, but since you only have 100 words to explain your interest in Dartmouth, there’s an added twist of testing how eloquently and effectively you can describe your connection to the College. As an Ivy League college, Dartmouth appeals to many applicants for its excellent academics and elite status within the world of higher education. But these are rather vague, surface-level attributes, that also apply to plenty of other schools around the country. So, to differentiate your response, you’ll need to get much more specific. Getting to the level of specificity you need will require a good amount of brainstorming, especially since the essay is so short. You want to make sure you have a clear idea of what you want to say before you start writing, or else you might end up using all 100 words without actually saying much of anything. To avoid that, reflect on your academic and career goals, and pick one or two (you really don’t have space for more than that) that are particularly important to you. Then, research specific resources available at Dartmouth that would help you achieve those goals. For example, say you want to pursue a career in environmental policy and conservation. You could highlight Dartmouth’s Environmental Studies study abroad program in Namibia and South Africa as a resource at Dartmouth that will deepen your understanding of how the climate crisis affects other parts of the world, where people have drastically different lifestyles. You could also talk about how you hope to work with Professor Bala Chaudhary through the two-term Presidential Research Scholarship, to study how to increase diversity in STEM fields, as you think it’s crucial that everyone has a seat at the table when discussing how to build towards a greener future. By citing specific examples of programs that can only be found at Dartmouth, you will show admissions officers 1) that you have done your research on their school, which shows you are genuinely interested and not just applying for fun, and 2) that you already have a clear sense of how you will fit into their campus community, which will give them confidence you are ready to start contributing to Dartmouth right away. Also remember that your life in college will be about more than just academics. If you have space, mention one extracurricular that you are interested in. It doesn’t necessarily have to be connected to the theme you’ve focused the rest of the essay on, as introducing another one of your interests can help make your response feel more thorough.",

Describe the environment in which you were raised and the impact it has had on the person you are today. This is basically a Diversity essay prompt, which means you want to do two things in your response. First, describe some particular feature of the environment in which you were raised. The prompt says just 'the environment,' but 250 words isn’t enough to flesh out every aspect of your upbringing. So, you want to narrow your focus to one feature that is especially relevant to understanding 'the person you are today.' Here are some examples of things you could zero in on: Being the oldest of 7 siblings, being raised by a single parent, how both of your parents being doctors shaped your worldview. Keep in mind that 'the environment in which you were raised' is a very open-ended phrase, so you can also get creative here if you want. For example, you could talk about you and your parents setting up a garden in your backyard, or about how your dad is a huge Beatles fan and played them non-stop while driving you to school. Basically, if something was an important part of your life growing up, it’s fair game to write about for this prompt. Once you’ve narrowed your focus, the second thing you want to do is explain how that feature of your environment shaped the person you are today.

This prompt gives you the opportunity to showcase your personality and talk about a passion, hobby, or experience that does not really 'fit' into the themes explored by other prompts. Think about this essay as a personal inquiry, it gives the admissions officer the ability to humanize your application and understand what type of person they are admitting to Dartmouth. There is no shortage of topics you can explore with this prompt. Are you excited whenever Sunday Night Football is able to bring together your family for a night? Or, are you excited when it rains outside and you can dance around with your friends? Or, are you excited when you get the opportunity to talk about gender equality at an organization that you intern at? Whether it’s a monumental achievement or a simple pleasure, at the core of this essay the admissions office is asking you to speak with passion. It’s important to connect whatever topic you are discussing to the resources and opportunities available to you at Dartmouth. For instance, if you are a student who gets super excited when you can collect rocks down at the beach with your friends, this would be a great chance to connect your passion back to research opportunities at Dartmouth in the Earth History department or how the outdoorsy-feel of Dartmouth would feel like home. Don’t be afraid to take a risk with this prompt. If watching Avatar excites you, feel free to explore this route, especially if you are an applicant that can connect this back to East-Asian studies or film/production studies at Dartmouth. However, be cautious about going on a tangent or exploring too many things within this essay. Stick to talking about one thing that excites you and connecting it back to Dartmouth.",

One of the best ways to improve your chances of acceptance during the admissions process is to submit essay responses that let your personality, beliefs, and passions shine.",

        "prompt_text": "There are just under 3,000 4-year colleges and universities in the United States. Being as specific as possible, what interests you most about Davidson College? (300 words)",
        "word_limit": "300 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Davidson’s first prompt falls under the standard “Why This College?” category. To answer this prompt, you’ll need to explain why Davidson College is the perfect college for you and why you’re an excellent fit for the community. To do this, you’ll need to show both tangible and intangible connections to the university. Your essay should ultimately demonstrate how your academic, professional, and extracurricular goals align specifically with the college’s resources. First, you’ll need to think about your goals for your college experience. These goals typically fall in one of the following categories: Academic knowledge, Social connections, Self-discovery, Career advancement. It’s best to focus on one to two goals in your essay, especially since the word count is limited to 300 words. For instance, a student planning to major in pre-medicine and apply to medical school after college may want to focus on the areas of academic knowledge and career advancement. Next, you’ll need to visit Davidson College’s website to research the classes, extracurriculars, programs, professors, traditions, or other on-campus opportunities that are unique to the school that can help reach your goals and create the college experience you’re searching for. These are your tangible connections to the university. For example, if the pre-med student mentioned above is excited about career advancement and growing academically, they may be excited for research opportunities at Davidson. However, they should not write, “I am interested in the biology research opportunities at Davidson.” In that sentence, Davidson could be interchangeable with any other university! Many universities offer biology research opportunities for undergraduate students, so this generalized response doesn’t highlight the resources provided at Davidson. Instead, this student should write about a particular topic or research opportunity unique to Davidson that interests them personally. It’s also important to connect the resource you choose with your personal goals. They might say: “I am excited to apply for the Duke-Davidson Immunology Partnership during my junior year for the unique opportunity to study the immune system with Professor Sophia Sarafova. I want to become an immunologist to help people like my sister, who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis, and I know this opportunity will give me valuable skills and knowledge to prepare me for my future career.” Next, take some time to reflect on Davidson College’s statement of purpose and understand why it appeals to you. These are your intangible connections to the university. Think about: Which of Davidson’s values are important to me? Why am I a good fit for Davidson’s community? How will these values impact my life at Davidson and post-college? Although you don’t need to answer these questions verbatim in your essay, it’s important to understand the school’s values to guide your response. For example, maybe you grew up in the Presbyterian church, so you want to attend a school that adheres to your Christian belief system. Or perhaps you appreciate Davidson College’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, specifically for the LGBTQ+ community, as a student who faced discrimination because of your sexual orientation in high school. Here are some tips for writing an excellent “Why This College?” essay: Stay focused. You may be tempted to list all the amazing resources at Davidson College, but doing so is a poor choice of words. The admissions counselor reading your essay already knows all the resources the university offers. Instead, focus on one to two things you love about Davidson that tie in with your personal goals for college and beyond. Avoid name-dropping. Don’t list distinguished professors, popular classes, or unique programs in your essay for the sake of naming them. Instead, explain why these resources are important to you (i.e., the unique opportunity to collaborate with a particular professor on a research opportunity in a specialized field). Specify your goals. It’s crucial to be as detailed as possible in describing how Davidson College can help you accomplish your goals for college and beyond. As the prompt said, there are nearly 3,000 universities you could have applied to. Why exactly are you applying to Davidson?",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "The purpose of this essay is to provide the college with a glimpse into your passions and interests and gives you a chance for you to dive deeper into a seemingly small concept or idea. You may have tons of ideas and activities that excite you, but the most crucial part of this essay is choosing one topic to focus on in-depth. If you jump around from one idea to another, you will lose your reader’s attention and diminish the impact of your essay. First, you’ll need to choose a topic to write about. It’s important to select a topic you’re passionate about rather than choosing something because it seems impressive. After all, the goal of this essay is to show off your interests and personality to the college! The essay needs to be an accurate reflection of what you value. For example: An avid hiker may choose to write about their goal to hike all 96 “fourteeners” in the United States before their 30th birthday. They may explain that climbing mountains is a physical and mental challenge that gives them a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Another approach to answering this essay is to use elegant language and sensory details to captivate your reader while describing your topic or activity. If you’re an excellent creative writer, this is a great prompt to showcase skills in a direct, interesting way. For example: If you’re passionate about golf, think about what you can hear, see, feel, and taste when you’re golfing. Maybe it’s the peacefulness of the course at sunrise, the smell of fresh-cut grass, and the cool breeze. These elements of golf all cater to the five senses. This student may start their essay with a sensory narrative about one of their favorite golfing experiences. Then, they should transition their essay to answering the prompt’s question: “Why does golfing excite you?” It’s important to focus your essay on your personal connection with the activity. Some students mistakenly focus solely on their narrative and forget to explain why that particular activity is significant to them and what it’s taught them. When brainstorming ideas for this essay, consider making a list of all the activities, hobbies, ideas, and topics that interest you most. Then, think about characteristics, themes, stories, and sensory details that relate to each topic. Choose an activity or idea with the most depth to simplify the writing process.",

Westphal encompasses a variety of majors that help artistic and creative individuals find practical and sustainable applications of their craft to high-demand industries. The Westphal College application is direct and focuses on your specific path. It also asks a core question: “Why pursue your selected major, and what experience have you had?” This is the classic “Why This Major?” essay. When answering the “why,” you can take a number of different approaches as long as you satisfy your primary goal of demonstrating that you are passionate about a subject. Why are you inspired to pursue your desired major? Why is your desired major important to you? Why will this major allow you to impact society more than another? These are all questions that you should be considering as you write. You can write about an experience that significantly impacted your life and has sparked your interest in a subject. Maybe it was a book, movie, or class that just clicked for you and helped you realize what you want to do with your life. Discuss how a subject excites you or changes the way in which you understand the world. Try to zone in on building a narrative so that the reader understands your perspective and thinks, “I can’t see this student studying anything but this major.” After introducing your interest, you want to explain what you have done that makes you qualified to be a student of a particular major at Westphal. Ideally, you want to develop an image of yourself as someone who found a passion and pursued it. If you have allowed your love for a subject to manifest outside of the classroom in the form of a personal project/pursuit or extracurricular activity, discuss that. It will show that you took advantage of your opportunities and turned an interest into something tangible and impactful. If you haven’t quite had the chance to further your interests, you can write about classes you’ve taken in school or books that you’ve read that relate to your desired major. Make sure you demonstrate your knowledge by delving deeply into the subjects to build around the underlying passion that you want to drive your essay. Even if you haven’t had much specific experience relating to your desired major, you can still write a strong essay. Oftentimes, your inspiration for pursuing a subject is the source of your experience. For example, someone seeking to study Game Design & Production may not have actually designed video games before, but perhaps has spent significant hours playing Pokémon and thus understands user interface and graphics. The primary goal is to indicate that your passion for a subject has manifested in ways that have given you insight and experience into your desired major, to prove that you are suited for the program.",

Be sure to explain why you want to be a physician and, more specifically, why you want to obtain your medical education at the Drexel University College of Medicine.",
        "word_limit": "500 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt asks students applying for the joint program with the Drexel University College of Medicine two questions: Why do you want to pursue medicine? (Why This Major?) and Why do you want to obtain your medical education from Drexel University? (Why This College?) To successfully answer this prompt, you’ll need to consider answers to both questions. Focus on your reasons for pursuing the medical field for about 300-350 words of your essay and why you’re interested in attending Drexel University’s College of Medicine for about 150-200 words. However, before you get started, consider these tips for writing an excellent medical essay: Blend scientific skills with human compassion. Most students who are pursuing healthcare are passionate about science. It’s important to blend your interest in diagnosing symptoms and prescribing treatment with your desire to care for humanity. Use personal healthcare stories. Do you have any previous medical experience? Perhaps you volunteered at a local hospital, shadowed a doctor, or worked at your school’s clinic. If you have a personal story from these experiences that inspired you to pursue a career in the medical field, you’ll want to use it in your essay. Demonstrate human care. Even if you don’t have experience in the medical field, think about a non-clinical volunteer opportunity that highlights your care for people, like a humanitarian trip. You may also want to share about a family member or friend who has battled severe health issues and why that inspired you to choose medicine as a career path. Try not to lean too heavily on the emotional aspect of these experiences, but rather why they sparked your interest in a medical career. Start your essay with a summary of reasons you’re interested in pursuing medicine. Like we mentioned earlier, these reasons should showcase a balance of the scientific and humanitarian aspects of medicine you are passionate about. You should spend roughly 150 words focusing on these reasons. Try to be as detailed as possible when selecting your reasons for applying to Drexel’s medical program. For example, saying that you want to “improve people’s lives” is far too general and should be assumed by someone interested in healthcare. Additionally, steer clear of cliches, like saying you want to “find the cure to cancer.” If this is truly a compelling reason you want to become a doctor, it’s ideal to have personal experiences that explain these broad claims. After explaining your reasons for pursuing medicine, you need to share the experiences that have led you to choose a medical career. These experiences can include coursework, job experiences, volunteer work, and patient care experiences. Ideally, you should include a personal anecdote that correlates with your reasons for choosing medicine that you listed earlier. You should spend roughly 200 words highlighting your experiences. As we mentioned earlier, it’s ideal to highlight a patient care experience, if possible. However, it’s important not to lean too heavily on the emotional appeal of life and death stories to avoid sounding cliche. To close out your essay, include a small summary of why you’d like to pursue medicine at Drexel University (about 150 words). Your reasons should be college-specific, and they should dive into the specific programs, classes, and out-of-classroom opportunities the university offers. The perfect litmus test to determine whether your reasons are too general is to insert another college’s name into the sentences. If the reasons still hold, they aren’t unique enough to Drexel University to be included in your essay. For instance, saying “I want to attend Drexel University because of the small class sizes” is too general. Instead, describe ambitions you have that could only be realized at Drexel, like: “I’m interested in attending the Drexel University College of Medicine because of the opportunity to dive into faculty-mentored undergraduate research so early in my education, right after my freshman year, as a part of the STAR Scholars Program. I’m also interested in attending the Intensive Course Abroad to Oslo, Norway, about ‘Understanding the Norwegian Approach to Public Health, Education, and Justice.’ This experience would help me gain a more holistic understanding of how healthcare systems are integrated into the broader social fabric of the country, which will make me a more empathetic physician as I one day treat Americans of all backgrounds.” Final note: Even if it’s true, don’t mention that you’re applying to the BA/BS+MD early assurance program to save time or money. Try to think of more profound reasons why this program is an excellent fit for you personally and what you have to offer to the university in return.",

Remember, however, that even though the Duke only wants 250 words, you’ll need to achieve the same level of impact in this response as you would with a 650 word essay. Clumsily jumbling together broad and lofty ideas won’t get you far with a 250 word prompt, so leave yourself enough time to plan, draft and redraft your response until it’s ready for submission. Be specific. Specificity is the not-so-secret ingredient when it comes to writing a successful response. Include anecdotes and examples that tie directly to what you know and value about the Duke campus community. Don’t simply say that you love research or that you want to change the world. Think about the specific experiences you have which exemplify your interests and your academic and professional aspirations. Be true to yourself. It’s counterproductive to spend hours and hours writing about things that don’t truly matter to you. Be honest! Highlight the things that you care about most and reflect on why they matter to you. Ultimately, the purpose of any supplemental essay is to give you the opportunity to present yourself, your experiences and achievements from your own perspective using your own words. So have fun with this process. After all, no one could ever be better equipped to showcase you than you.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Every student applying to Duke will be submitting this “Why This College?” essay, so you really need to make yours stand out. Before we talk about what you should do, let’s cover common mistakes to avoid so your essay isn’t generic. Don’t talk about factors outside of the school’s control like the location, weather, or surrounding city. You might be attracted to Duke because you want to go to a school in the South, but there are hundreds of other schools nearby. This doesn’t tell us anything about Duke in particular. Don’t make emotional appeals like “It feels like home” or “The campus is so beautiful”. Contrary to popular belief, statements like these don’t flatter admissions officers because they read them so frequently. Saying something like this is too vague and your limited space would be better served describing resources that make you feel connected to the school. Don’t regurgitate fun facts and statistics from a campus tour, brochure, or website. Duke doesn’t need to be told how many Nobel prize winners or cabinet secretaries attended, nor do they need to be told about the infamous Duke vs UNC game. Admissions officers especially don’t care about the student-to-faculty ratio or class sizes. Listing these as reasons for attending signals to the admissions committee you didn’t research specific offerings at the school and you might not be as dedicated. Don’t talk badly about the school. This one should be pretty self-explanatory, but when they ask about your sense of Duke, don’t call it stuffy and pretentious! You are trying to prove your love and devotion to the school, so if you have a negative impression, maybe reconsider why you are applying. Don’t list out a dozen reasons why you want to go to Duke. We recommend including specific offerings and resources at Duke that excite you, but it’s all about quality over quantity. Spend time explaining why each reason resonates with you or what you hope to get out of the resource or experience. If that means you only have space to include three or four, then that’s okay! Now that you know what not to do, we’ll share some tips on what you should do in your essay to make it stand out. Make it personal. Like any other college essay, you need to share information about yourself and your interests to demonstrate to the admissions committee why you belong at Duke. Include anecdotes or details about your experiences to highlight your personal connection to the offerings at Duke. Include specific resources and opportunities you want to take advantage of. The prompt makes it seem like it is more optional to include offerings that speak to you, but we strongly urge you to include them! Not only does including specific offerings demonstrate the research you’ve done, it also allows you to talk more about your interests and goals through the resources you are attracted to. Balance academic and extracurricular reasons for wanting to attend. In order to show the admissions committee you are well-rounded, you’ll need to discuss both academic and extracurricular offerings that excite you. Your extracurriculars could be related to the academic topic you’re studying, but make sure to include clubs or communities you want to join so Duke knows you will be active both in class and out. Draw parallels between yourself and Duke to emphasize why it’s a good fit for you. This might be a little harder to conceptualize and implement in your essay, but you could go about this by finding a club on campus that aligns with one of your extracurriculars, a professor who conducts research on a topic you want to learn more about, or values the school exemplifies that you prioritize. Have a strong narrative that still reads like a story. Just because this essay might not be as creative or story-based as other college essays doesn’t mean it can’t have a narrative style. Make sure you have an exciting hook at the beginning and a conclusion that ties everything together. Have some fun! Your essay should still have a voice that is uniquely yours, so if that means you like to use humor, go for it. Also, you can mention fun aspects of the college experience at Duke—basketball is a huge part of the Duke experience. Just be sure that you frame it as an additional bonus of attending Duke and not the primary reason for choosing the school.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is one instance of the very common diversity prompt. When colleges have a diversity prompt, they want to know about your own personal background and how it has influenced your worldview and perspectives. A quick note if you intend to write about your racial background: In June 2023, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling, however, still allows colleges to consider race on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts as one of their supplemental essay prompts. If you feel that your racial background has impacted you significantly, this is the place to discuss that. In general, such a common prompt can be approached with a traditional answer. You might consider answering this prompt with what you think is the most important part of your identity, then a small discussion about how that aspect of diversity is relevant to you and your general life experiences. Such a response might be written about one of the following scenarios: Using your fluency in another language to help members of a specific community. Interpreting a text in class differently from your classmates because of your ethnic culture. Having a friend of a different background who has changed your perspective on something important. Having an illness or disability that helps you view accessibility through a different lens than your peers. Being part of a niche interest group/fandom and trying to represent the group faithfully when talking to people who aren’t members of it. Simply listing things that generate diversity should be avoided. Sure, diversity includes different ethnicities/races, gender identities, sexual orientations, countries of origin, and languages, but writing that laundry list out doesn’t contribute much to your application. Also, bear in mind that the traditional markers of diversity aren’t the only ones you can discuss. There are other aspects of identity that contribute to a diverse campus, including socioeconomic classes, hometowns, illnesses/disabilities, and even interests or hobbies. This being said, let’s look at a potential example response: “Growing up as the daughter of Mexican immigrants, I often found myself translating for my parents at parent-teacher conferences, doctor’s appointments, and even grocery stores. These early experiences made me acutely aware of the barriers faced by non-English speaking communities. This awareness fueled my passion for educational equity, leading me to start a tutoring program for ESL students at my high school. Every Saturday, I helped students navigate their schoolwork while also bridging cultural gaps through shared stories and experiences. At Duke, I hope to continue advocating for underrepresented communities by joining the Center for Multicultural Affairs and collaborating with organizations like Duke LIFE (Low-Income, First-Generation Engagement). I am excited to contribute my unique perspective and learn from a community that values diverse experiences as much as I do. By sharing my background and listening to others, I aim to foster a more inclusive environment where everyone feels heard and valued.”",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "For this prompt, Duke is looking to hear about your intellectual interests and your approach to learning. You could choose anything; for example, a particular class you took that sparked your interest in a topic, an individual research project you conducted, a book you read that made a strong impression, or an experiment you performed in a science class. The key for this essay is to really highlight your passion for learning, and the way to accomplish that is to tell the reader everything about the experience so they feel like they are living it besides you. The phrase “show, don’t tell” is thrown around a lot when it comes to college essays—this essay will be no exception. But what does it mean to successfully show your intellectual experience? Let’s dissect an example. “Debates were my favorite part of my AP US History class. At the end of every unit, each person in the class would be assigned a historical figure and we would debate a prevalent issue for the period. The best one, hands down, was the debate about the ratification of the Constitution. Representing James Madison, I advocated for a separation of powers. I also pushed for the inclusion of unalienable rights. The fast-paced environment of kids in my class engaging in productive debate was so exciting to see.” While the excerpt above does technically check the box of describing an intellectual experience this student enjoyed, this is far from what you should submit if you want to be a competitive applicant. How can we make this better? Starting with the hook, never restate the prompt. The first line of your essay shouldn’t be used to tell us what the experience was, rather it should set the scene so the reader is prepared to immerse themselves in the experience, for example: “Accusations flew across the circle of desks haphazardly gathered in the center of the room; she was an elitist forgetting about the yeomen while he was as backwards as King George.” This hook immediately brings action and excitement, causing the reader to ask questions which makes them more interested to keep reading. Not only that, by including details relevant to the academic topic (yeomen farmers and King George) it further demonstrates the student’s knowledge and interest of this subject. The next two sentences can be improved by making them more concise to cut down on the amount of background needed. You want to keep the essay focused in the moment as much as possible, so rather than zooming out to provide the reader with context, stay in the present: “With the strike of my US History teacher’s gavel, our debate on the ratification of the Constitution had begun.” The student then goes on to talk about their contribution to the debate, which is important to include, but we can make it stronger. Again, the key is to stay in the story and tell it in present tense with an active voice. Focus on how you viewed and approached the situation rather than what actions you took. Not only will this make the writing more engaging, it will also make it naturally easier to express your fascination with the experience—which is the whole purpose of this essay at the end of the day.",

Whether you choose to write about an agreement or disagreement, at the heart of your essay, you need to share one of your important values with the admissions committee.

If religion is important to you, this prompt would be a good opportunity to delve into your religious beliefs. Similarly, you could choose to go into philosophical or ethical debates that you have with people. As you pick a belief or value, keep your audience in mind. You never know who will read your essay, and the last thing you want to do is offend them. It’s generally a good idea to stay away from any beliefs that might be highly controversial or politicized. Not only do you need a belief or value, you also need to pick a discussion partner that either shares your ideals or challenges them. Luckily for you, because the prompt already asks for you to pick a person, it opens the door for the natural inclusion of dialogue—a great way to spice up your essay and show, not tell! This essay also provides you with a chance to delve deeper into your personality. You can demonstrate character traits you possess in the way you describe your conversation.

There’s a delicate balance between including enough information to write a strong essay and protecting personal details. To try and address this, focus on actions you took and the emotions that motivated them, without getting too deep into the intricacies of your thoughts. However, at the end of the day, your college essay has to reveal to the admissions officers what makes you special.

An essay where a student describes her family’s low income and the lack of luxuries she’s able to afford as a result doesn’t tell us much about the student.

But the essay shouldn’t stop there. Now that we know about her mental response to her difference, we want to hear about how she views her difference as a source of strength and personal value. So, maybe her classmates’ focus on fashion inspired her to start a thrifting collective at her school where students can donate old clothes and find new ones without spending a lot of money. This experience taught her the value in creating community and compassion.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is required for students who are applying to Duke Kunshan University through the Duke University application. Duke Kunshan is a partnership between Duke and Wuhan University in China that allows students to receive an education that marries two exceptional universities. You are asked to submit a pretty straightforward “Why This College?” essay for Duke Kunshan, and we would refer you to Prompt 1 in this post to learn more about the tips and common pitfalls to avoid when writing this type of essay. A key factor to keep in mind when submitting this essay is although Duke will be reading it, it will also be sent to Duke Kunshan who will review it. For that reason, you want to make sure the college you are discussing is specifically Duke Kunshan and not regular Duke. Along those lines, you need to speak highly of Kunshan as its own entity—don’t say you want to attend because you think it will be an easier way to achieve a Duke degree. While we normally advise against listing a school’s location as a reason for wanting to attend, in the case of an international university, it is okay to discuss your interest in Duke Kunshan because it’s in another country. However, frame it within the context of an interest in experiencing new cultures or an appreciation for Chinese history, culture, or society. Make sure your motivation for attending an international institution is clear in your essay. The second part of the prompt asks you to consider what you can bring to the school. Just as you would for any other “Why This College?” essay, highlight ways your interests and experiences align with resources and offerings at the university. Your contribution to the campus community can also lie outside of academics. Perhaps you will bring your favorite comfort food recipe with you to support your fellow homesick American students or maybe you will share your adventurous spirit with your more reserved classmates to encourage them to explore a new environment with you.",

        "word_limit": "250 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "If you indicate on the Common App that you are considering taking a gap year before enrolling at Duke, you will be required to answer this question. It’s important to note that this isn’t an official declaration of your plans; Duke is using this question to gauge what type of individual you are and how you will use your time productively. But at the same time, don’t make up fanciful gap year plans like traveling to all seven continents if realistically you know you will spend the majority of your time working at home. You aren’t being judged on how exciting your gap year plans may sound, so be genuine about the plans you are considering. There are many reasons you might be considering a gap year—from wanting to gain more real-world experience, to financial reasons, to unique opportunities you don’t want to miss, to family commitments—and there are an infinite number of ways to spend your year, whether it’s traveling, getting an internship, working on a campaign, supporting your family, etc. When it comes to this essay though, there are two primary things you want to convey: What you consider to be valuable. How you will grow and be enriched from the gap year. Starting with the first point, the way you choose to spend your gap year is a reflection of the values you find important. Students who want to travel value broadening their perspectives and embracing new experiences, while students who are staying home to help out their parents value family, loyalty, and devotion. Unless you are spending your time in the basement playing video games all day long, you will be doing something that, in your mind, is considered a productive use of time. When you are discussing your plans, your values should come through. For example, if you are planning to spend the first semester backpacking South America, you wouldn’t just say, “I will spend the first four months backpacking in China.” You would instead show the admissions committee why you are driven to take that action: “During my four months exploring the mountains, valleys, cities, and ancient civilizations of China, I will immerse myself in the culture I’ve felt so distant from as a Chinese adoptee.” The second thing your essay needs to discuss is how this experience will enrich you. Or, from Duke’s perspective, how will taking a gap year make you a more valuable member of the campus community? To answer this question, you’ll need to place yourself in a year-from-now you’s shoes and ask how you’ve changed and grown. Are you more independent? Are you confident? Did you learn a new skill? Have you become a stronger leader? Do you have a new appreciation for learning? However you think you will grow from this experience, make sure to convey that in your essay. You might also want to explicitly mention what you will bring back to the Duke community, just to reiterate your commitment to attending Duke after your gap year.",

A good response needs to do three things: (1) show your interest in the major through an experience, (2) explain how the major will help you achieve your goals, and (3) demonstrate what resources at the school will help you achieve your goals. You want to start your essay by showing admissions officers your excitement and engagement in the major you have chosen. What positive (or even negative) experiences have you had with this subject that have influenced you? A student interested in Creative Writing might talk about how she sees characters in people walking down the street, mythical lands in the places she’s traveled, and new stories that must be told whenever she listens to conversations around her. A student interested in Nutrition Science could describe how understanding the science behind the food he ate through independent research helped him turn around his life and lose weight. The easiest way to convey your interest is to use a strong, detailed, and meaningful anecdote. What do you want to be when you grow up? It’s okay to not know exactly what you want, but you should have a pretty decent idea of what field you are interested in or what type of work you see yourself enjoying. If you know that you want to generate cleaner forms of energy to solve the climate crisis, you would mention how majoring in Environmental Sciences will teach you not only the ecological origins of issues facing the world, but how to think creatively to develop feasible solutions. This final step shows the admissions officers that you are genuinely interested in their school and took the time to do outside research. You will want to include resources (classes, professors, research opportunities, study abroad, extracurriculars, etc) that are specific and unique to Emory that you plan to take advantage of while on campus. You can think of the entire essay like a bridge. On one side you have your past experiences and passion for a topic. On the other side, your future career goals and aspirations await you. The only way to get to the other side is by studying your intended major at Emory and utilizing the resources available to you, or crossing the bridge.",

Along those same lines, as you brainstorm, keep in mind that college essays, like any other genre of writing, have cliches. Many applicants have had a 'voluntourism' experience — that is, a service trip that benefited the student more than the community they were visiting. Not only are voluntourism stories cliche, they can also make you sound privileged and condescending. Every admissions officer has read countless 'I was there to teach them, but really they taught me' essays. That said, you can still talk about your service trip experience!

However, the goal of this essay is deeper than that. Remember, admissions essays are pieces of the puzzle that when pieced together, ideally show the admissions committee a comprehensive picture of you. Thus, this question is also seeking to understand what sociopolitical, economic, or environmental issues are important to you, and why. Given the phrasing of the question, this prompt would be essential for applicants planning to major in international affairs or the social sciences. Here are two interpretations of the prompt: If you could go back in time, what critical local, national, or global historical event would you change? How would you inflict such a change? Why? Currently, what is a problem plaguing our society that you would work to resolve if you had all the power necessary to do so? What actions would you take, why, and how would those actions alter our future? Given the deliberate ambiguity of the question, you can choose either interpretation as your springboard. Just be sure to formulate your opening paragraph in a way that makes it clear how you chose to interpret the question. Regardless of which route you decide on, the objective of your response is to suggest a solution to the problem you deem most critical. You are limited to a mere 250 words, so make sure to establish the context of your chosen issue with brevity and precision in a manner that will frame your solution. Then, get straight to the point: identify the problem or past event that affected the course of human history and suggest a more promising course of action. A few tips and words of caution: Don’t pick a topic or problem that is too broad. If you are considering present-day issues in your response, don’t discuss something vague like 'global poverty' or 'illiteracy in developing nations.' No one individual is able to provide a concrete and feasible plan of action to such major problems of international significance, let alone a high school student with 250 words at their disposal. The strategy is to pick a sub-issue of a larger problem that affects a specific population. For example, instead of addressing illiteracy in the developing world, you can delineate a proposal to increase literacy in rural schools with understaffed faculty, and connect it to your own background of growing up in a community where access to higher education and associated economic opportunities was inadequate. Or, you can suggest a measure to combat food insecurity for low-income students in Native-American reservations and relate that to your experience of witnessing hunger in your school cafeteria. Make your choice of issue specific, and your response to it personal. Don’t bring up a historical cliché. If you are taking the historical route, avoid silly or overused instances. For example, don’t write about going back to the 1930s and killing Hitler in order to prevent WWII. Such responses would show the admissions committee that you are not serious, or worse yet, that your critical analysis is insufficient to provide a more nuanced reflection. Try to think of historical events that were impactful to your personal or family background and are under-reported in the media. If you grew up in a community of interracial children raised by single parents, you may want to draw attention to the unique experiences and challenges this demographic faces in trying to grapple with their whole identity while heavily influenced only by one particular side. Be specific. Give clear examples of actions you would take or policies you would implement in order to affect meaningful change. Don’t write broadly about educating more girls; instead, outline steps the government could take to narrow the gender literacy gap by allocating more funds to local schools or dedicating a certain portion of research grants to underrepresented women. Instead of declaring that you would go back to 18th century United States and eliminate slavery, discuss the logical arguments and personal leverage you would use in lobbying influential generals and statesmen of the time to back a more egalitarian Constitution. Ultimately, the prompt aims to gauge your personal values and determine your ability to think critically, to focus on worthwhile problems, and to propose realistic solutions. The admissions committee is looking to admit students who are passionate about examining pressing issues, quick to identify key stakeholders, and able to imagine plausible alternatives.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "At its core, this prompt determines your ability to thrive in an intellectual environment punctuated by a diversity of opinions, as well as your capability to enact meaningful change in your community. At a time of increasing politicization, the admissions committee wants to attract students who are able to listen to each other and who can use their powers of persuasion to promote their point of view. You don’t need a dramatic example to highlight your abilities to listen and persuade others. Here are some ideas of the kinds of moments in your life that will highlight the qualities necessary for the completion of this prompt. If you are an active member or leader of a club, you can invoke a situation in which you and other fellow members disagreed on the action the club should take. For example, you can write about the time you convinced your classmates to donate a significant sum to a local soup kitchen, instead of retaining it as part of the club budget, by appealing to their emotional side with photos of the people the kitchen is helping, and the statistics of the demographic it would reach. You can also share a story in which you convinced another student of the validity of your point in a classroom debate, formal or informal. For example, write about the time when you used a compelling example that involved someone your debate opponent related to as you advocated for legalizing gay marriage in your U.S. history class, thus convincing her of LGBTQ individuals’ right to marriage. Alternatively, discuss the challenges of convincing the Board of Education to support your initiative to start a new club. For example, if you tried to start a Girls in STEM club and were rebuffed by the administration on the grounds that the school already sponsored a Science Club, you could outline the arguments you used and the awareness campaign you launched in order to ultimately secure the necessary funding. No matter what kind of example you choose, don’t forget that the prompt wants you to demonstrate that both you and the other party gained something from the experience. It is not enough to tell the admissions committee about a fight you had with a classmate who didn’t believe in abortion on religious grounds. You need to demonstrate your ability to persuade others, even those with radically different opinions, so dig deep and pick a success story as the example. Anyone can argue, but not everyone can express their ideas and exchange perspectives in a respectful and productive way. Perhaps you engaged a fellow classmate in a class debate that led you to form a life-long friendship, despite your political differences. Or, maybe you were able to develop a project that others initially opposed and convinced them of its value. Make sure that your response highlights a lesson learned or an impact made.",

Within the UHP, students take classes in many different academic fields (philosophy, science, history, art, social science, etc.) and hone their critical thinking skills. Explain why, as a member of the UHP, you would value the opportunity to engage with topics outside your major field(s) of study. (500 words)",
        "word_limit": "500",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is rather similar to the common 'Why This College?' essay, but it’s specifically tailored to the GW’s Honors Program. The Honors Program is a rigorous addition to your GW education. It was created to provide an interdisciplinary education to students so they can address real-world problems in well-rounded ways. If you love to learn for its own sake and you enjoy dabbling in several subjects, this program might be perfect for you! Before beginning your response, think about your prospective major(s) and career goals and how courses in other fields can support those goals. This prompt is essentially two parts: one, explaining why you value an interdisciplinary education, and two, how UHP specifically can support your goals/education. For the first part, here’s an example. Say you want to be a doctor. While a STEM degree will give you the scientific foundation and knowledge to go to med school, medicine is an inherently interdisciplinary field; it’s not only scientific but also social, political, and economic. You want to be able to effectively treat patients from different socioeconomic backgrounds and advocate for better healthcare policy, especially as a low-income immigrant child who has experienced barriers to getting healthcare. As you explain the reasons you value an interdisciplinary education, make sure to also explain your why. Anyone who wants to be a doctor could explain how you need to be well-rounded, but that hypothetical student has a life story that backs up their motivation. For the next part of your essay, you’ll want to cite specific Honors Program resources that will support your interdisciplinary education. Explore the course offerings to find classes that pique your curiosity. The above student might mention the course Well-Being, which approaches wellness from a wide variety of cultures and philosophies. They could also mention wanting to pursue an Honors Contract course. This unique opportunity allows you to receive academic credit for academic-focused projects outside of class. You can pursue an internship, undergraduate research project, or research assistantships in a field that catches your eye while getting college credit! This particular student might want to do a contract course focused on public health. Keep in mind you have 500 words to work with, which is on the long side for a supplement, so you do have room to explore a few different interests you have within the program. However, you likely won’t be able to talk about every single thing you want to do, so try to focus on just 2-4, to make sure you have room to elaborate on them and your essay doesn’t turn into a bullet-point list. No matter what you decide to write about, be sure to center your response around your passions and goals, this personal aspect is what will ultimately make your essay unique and authentic.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "At first glance, this prompt certainly seems to have some overlap with the previous question. Both prompts are variations on the 'Why This College?' essay, but separates your reasoning into two distinct categories. While you should dive into the course offerings and academics that led you to applying to the Honors Program in the previous prompt, this prompt asks you to explain why this specific community is not only a good fit for you, but why you’ll be a good fit for the community and what you’ll add to it as a whole. First, make sure you outline what you’re looking for in a college experience outside of the classroom, and how that can support your academic and personal goals. For example, the student who wants to be a doctor may want a mentor (which is especially helpful for pre-professional paths), is interested in hosting study groups (great for STEM classes), and ways to have fun with classmates outside of academics (necessary for a work-life balance). Next, do some research on exactly what the Honors Program offers students as far as community. The prompt itself gives you a good head start on what your experience will look like as you move through your studies, but a great answer to this prompt will dig deeper. Starting with the Mount Vernon campus experience, not only will Honors students live in the same residence hall, but they will live on the same two floors, meaning the Honors Program offers a built-in community both in and out of the classroom. Showcasing how this built-in community would enhance your college experience is imperative when answering this prompt. For the pre-med student, they may mention how this dorm experience will make it easy to organize study groups and meetings with peer advisors. Be sure to also take a look at the co-curricular and social activities that the Honors Programs offers exclusively to their students. The event calendar from previous terms is a great starting place to get a look at some of the past events hosted by the program. From the 2022-23 school year, the Program hosted events such as a Fire Pits on the Quad, Soul Food events, and hikes. As you discuss the different community resources that interest you, make sure to explain your why and how they’ll support your professional and life goals. And, make sure to outline how you’ll contribute to the community, not just what it will do for you. If you don’t see any specific events that you’d love to participate in, you can even say that you’d like to organize it yourself.",

Applicants to this Institute are expected to be dedicated to 'community' conceptually, to the Hispanic community, and to the cohort community they will be a part of throughout their college careers. Read more about the Institute’s mission, academic programs, and research before you begin writing. After doing this research on the program, consider your specific reasons for applying to the Cisneros Institute. Think about how you have tangible and intangible connections to the program. A tangible connection involves resources like the academic programs, specific faculty members, and research opportunities. An intangible connection involves things that aren’t physical, such as the program’s culture and its values. Once you’ve figured these things out, you can create a specific plan for how you’ll engage with the program. For example, perhaps you’re drawn to the Cisneros Undergraduate Research Fellowship because you have a research idea that involves studying how Hispanic people are treated based on the intensity of their Spanish accent. You might find ways in which this idea appeals to the members of your cohort, who may know people with strong accents. Conducting a full-length research project with your cohort can contribute greatly to a sense of community within it. You can also think of this prompt as a future-tense version of the community service essay. A typical community service prompt asks how you have contributed to a community in the past. This prompt is asking how you will create a sense of comunidad in the future. One way to start thinking about your response is to look to the past. To do this, ask yourself a few questions: in what ways have you created a sense of community before? What actions did you take? What values did these actions instill in others within that community? Once you have a good idea of how you have contributed to a community in the past, you can apply some of these ideas to your future cohort. Perhaps you will work to help others in your cohort if they start to struggle academically, since you created a helpful study group for your AP Calculus class in high school. Maybe you’re a home cook and know how soothing a familiar recipe is, so you want to organize weekly group dinners at the Casa Cisneros (the living-learning community), where you cook recipes passed down from the families of people in the cohort. One important program that Cisneros scholar cohorts participate in is Caminos al Futuro, a pre-college residential summer program in which 'Caminos scholars examine the social, economic and political transformations affecting the Hispanic/Latino community in a college-like environment.' According to GW, cohorts often serve as counselors and mentors for this program, so you may want to mention how you will serve as a role model for your cohort as well as the program participants in your capacity as counselor.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is the classic Extracurricular Essay, and it’s a great opportunity to showcase your unique passions and experiences to the admissions committee. The open-ended nature of this prompt provides you with a great deal of flexibility to highlight parts of your personality that you haven’t had the chance to express in other parts of your application. In order to most effectively answer this prompt, write about the activity that you are most passionate about AND explain why this activity is meaningful to you. For many students, sports are likely one of the first topics that come to mind when thinking about significant activities outside of the classroom. However, since they are a very common topic for prompt responses, essays about sports can often fall prey to cliché themes that may get lost in a sea of other sports-related essays. If you choose to write about a sport, be very thoughtful about how you frame your experience. Think about what makes your experience stand out from other applicants’ sports stories. For example, scoring the winning touchdown at a championship game may have been an exhilarating memory, but how is your passion for the game unique to your experience? Maybe there was a time where you had to overcome adversity or things didn’t turn out the way you had hoped. Perhaps an injury left you on the bench for the rest of the season or an unfair call from a referee that cost you the game — explain how these challenges contributed to your overall experience with the activity, even when the situation was not ideal. When the prompt asks for the activity with which you have been most involved, it does not necessarily refer to the number of hours you spent. The prompt specifies that it is asking about the activity that you have been “most involved” in. Therefore, the activity that you choose to write about should be something that shows your ongoing dedication to the activity. However, the activity that you spend the most time doing may not be the activity you are most passionate about. While it is fantastic if your chosen activity directly ties into the major you’re planning to pursue, don’t worry too much about picking something that you deem most relevant to your field. In this essay, the admissions committee is looking to understand your passions, the skills you gained, your strengths as a leader or a team player, and your dedication. If you can demonstrate your commitment to, say, teaching ukulele to small kids, along with your creativity and excitement in approaching the task at hand, you will show the admissions committee that you have acquired transferable skills which you will apply with the same intensity to your collegial pursuits. Don’t try to second-guess what the admissions committee may or may not wish to see. Pick an activity that makes you the most excited — the one you never cease to talk about with your friends and family — and write about why it’s important.",

Colleges can still consider race on an individual level, however, so if you would like to write your response about how your racial identity has impacted you, you are welcome to do so. If race doesn’t seem like the right topic for you, however, keep in mind that there are many other things that can make us different, not just race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and the other aspects of our identities that people normally think of when they hear the word “diversity.” That’s not to say that you can’t write about those things, of course. But don’t worry if you don’t feel like those things have played a significant role in shaping your worldview. Here are some examples of other topics that could support a strong essay: Moving to several different cities because of your parents’ jobs, An unusual hobby, like playing the accordion or making your own jewelry, Knowing a lot about a niche topic, like Scottish castles. The only questions you really need to ask yourself when picking a topic are “Does this thing set me apart from other people?” and “Will knowing this thing about me give someone a better sense of who I am overall?” As long as you can answer “yes” to both of those questions, you’ve found your topic! Once you’ve selected a topic, the question becomes how you’re going to write about that topic in a way that helps Harvard admissions officers better understand how you’re going to contribute to their campus community. To do that, you want to connect your topic to some broader feature of your personality, or to a meaningful lesson you learned, that speaks to your potential as a Harvard student.

While a disagreement may not always be big enough to be considered a true challenge, some of the same general strategy applies, in that as you reflect on the conflict, you want to demonstrate your personal strengths and maturity. As you consider what anecdote to use for this essay, think about what qualities might be demonstrated by different stories. Here are some examples, to help you gauge how well your own ideas would work: A disagreement with a friend or family member could demonstrate your readiness to stand up to even those who are close to you in defense of something important to you. A conflict involving one of your core values or beliefs might demonstrate your strong moral character and commitment to ethics. An argument involving a cause, organization, or project might show your commitment to something bigger than you. An argument in which you were wrong or your mind was changed shows your humility, capacity for reflection, and willingness to listen. There are many more kinds of disagreements that you could write about, so make sure you choose wisely. The most emotional argument you’ve ever been in, the most significant conflict you’ve ever had, or the most satisfying win, doesn’t automatically make for the best essay. The key is to write about an occasion that gives a clear impression of your best qualities, which is not always the most intense one. You’ll also want to lay out the contours of the disagreement relatively briefly, so don’t choose a situation that’s difficult to explain. Remember, you only have 150 words, and you want to spend as few of them as possible describing the argument itself. Rather, the majority of your supplement should focus on how you resolved (or not) the conflict, and what you learned from it.",

As such, what you need to do is well-defined, although it’s easier said than done: select an extracurricular activity that has, as Harvard says, “shaped who you are,” and make sure you’re able to articulate how it’s been formative for you. As you brainstorm which extracurricular you want to write about, note that the language of the prompt is pretty open-ended. You write about “any” activity, not just one you have a lot of accolades in, and you don’t even have to write about an activity—you can also write about a travel experience, or family responsibility. If the thing that immediately jumps to mind is a club, sport, volunteer experience, or other “traditional” extracurricular, that’s great! Run with that. But if you’re thinking and nothing in that vein seems quite right, or, alternatively, you’re feeling bold and want to take a creative approach, don’t be afraid to get outside the box. Here are some examples of other topics you could write a strong essay about: A more hobby-like extracurricular, like crocheting potholders and selling them on Etsy, Driving the Pacific Coast Highway on your own, Caring for your family’s two large, colorful macaws. These more creative topics can do a lot to showcase a different side of you, as college applications have, by their nature, a pretty restricted scope, and telling admissions officers about something that would never appear on your resume or transcript can teach them a lot about who you are. That being said, the most important thing is that the topic you pick has genuinely been formative for you. Whether it’s a conventional topic or not, as long as that personal connection is there, you’ll be able to write a strong essay about it.",

You don’t have to have your whole life mapped out, but you do need to be a lot more specific than “Make a difference in the world.” A more zoomed-in version of that goal would be something like “Contribute to conservation efforts to help save endangered species,” which would work. Second, hop onto Harvard’s website and do some research on opportunities the school offers that would help you reach your goals. Again, make sure these are specific enough. Rather than a particular major, which is likely offered at plenty of other schools around the country, identify specific courses within that major you would like to take, or a professor in the department you would like to do research with. For example, the student interested in conservation might mention the course “Conservation Biology” at Harvard. You could also write about a club, or a study abroad program, or really anything that’s unique to Harvard, so long as you’re able to draw a clear connection between the opportunity and your goal. Just make sure that, like with your goals, you don’t get overeager. Since your space is quite limited, you should choose two, or maximum three, opportunities to focus on.

Questions this broad can be hard to answer, as you might not know where to start. Sometimes, you can help yourself out by asking yourself adjacent, but slightly more specific questions, like the following: Do you have any interests that influence your regular routine? For example, do you always watch the Seahawks on Sunday, or are you going to be playing Taylor Swift’s discography on repeat while you study? Look around your room—what items are most important to you? Do you keep your movie ticket stubs? Are you planning on taking your photos of your family cat with you to college? Are there any activities you love and already know you’d want to do with your roommate, like weekly face masks or making Christmas cookies?

The admissions committee wants to know where you come from, where you’re going, and why. HMC has a diverse pool of applicants, so they want to see the different perspectives that are being brought to their institution.\n\nYou should ask yourself some questions before writing to guide the direction of your essay:\nWhat is a specific community that you belong to or background that you have that has impacted you and your development? Community can refer to people who share the same:\n- Ethnicity/Race\n- Gender\n- Country of origin\n- Language\n- Hometown\n- Income class\n- Illness\n- Interests/activities\n\nHow do you feel about your background? Think about some important experiences you had as a result of your background. Was there a formative experience that revealed a larger challenge or obstacle to your community? How has your identity influenced your outlook on the world? In what ways has your background impacted your goals for the future (major, career, projects, etc.)?\n\nIf you look at all the definitions above, you undoubtedly belong to several communities, but it’s best to focus on only one for this essay. You don’t want to list several communities and run out of room before elaborating on how one of them has contributed to your identity and worldview.\n\nOnce you’ve decided on the community you want to use, consider how it has changed your conception of the world. This can take many forms. Maybe you came from a working class area, and this upbringing inspired you to pursue civil engineering with the goal of fixing your town’s infrastructure. Or maybe you’re an African-American woman who noticed that your intersectional identity was underrepresented in medicine. Perhaps this background has made you want to study biology with the goal of becoming a doctor and serving your community.\n\nFor example, a student may begin to respond to this prompt like this:\n\"Grab your rain boots, the streets are flooded again!\" I peered outside the window and yelled to my parents as we prepared to go grocery shopping.\n\nGrowing up in a small, coastal town, we occasionally experienced flooding, but it’d only gotten more frequent as we’d gotten older due to climate change. I ran out the door and splashed through the ankle-deep water to our elderly neighbor’s home, to ask if she needed anything from the store. I visited her weekly for tea and cookies, and she’d tell me stories of growing up in her home and all the mischief her and her brother got into. I knew it wasn’t safe for her to go outside in these conditions. But despite all the flooding, she refused to move because she’d lived in our town her whole life.\n\nAfter learning about the solutions to coastal flooding in environmental science last year, I resolved to become a civil engineer to keep towns like my own safe, so that families could continue living there for generations to come…\n\nThis example is strong for several reasons. It commands the reader’s attention immediately while establishing the author’s background vividly. It then characterizes the exact kind of issue the author wishes to confront with her future work.\n\nThink of this prompt as a sort of introduction to your identity. It should explain something about who you are, which will in turn give the admissions committee a clear idea of what makes you tick–your motivations and aspirations. Make sure to be sincere and concise, but also as comprehensive as you can be about the influence your background has had on your thinking.",

If you want, you can even propose a course that blends STEM and non-STEM fields, such as the one written about in the example essay.\n\nBefore you begin writing, check out HMC’s list of HSA courses to ensure you don’t describe a class that already exists.

College applications don’t give you many chances to make an impression, so when you get an extra one, seize it!\n\nAt first blush, this might look like another essay about your accomplishments, but note that Harvey Mudd also gives you the freedom to share “creative projects.” So, you could also include photos of artistic projects, creative writing samples, or any endeavors you’ve pursued as hobbies.\n\nWhatever your passion may be, here is the space for your best work. That could be what you feel is most unique, what you’re most proud of, what is most impressive, or what you think will add the most to your application. Make sure you present your work clearly and concisely–you might consider including short descriptions of what each thing is–and that the work is relevant to understanding your potential as a college student, without being redundant.

For example, if you’ve written about your love of math, perhaps you want to share some extra-credit problems you worked particularly hard on. Alternatively, you could include a short, humorous poem you wrote about different kinds of triangles. Or, if you hope to be an electrical engineer, a circuit that helped you win a competition would be a great selection. Of course, if you have a wide variety of interests, don’t let these examples limit you from showing off another passion of yours.

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is an excellent opportunity for you to showcase your interest in a specific subject or topic. Although it is not a “Why Major?” prompt, as you have the freedom to write about any of your intellectual interests, not just your intended major, the overall structure of the essay will be similar: you want to select one of your interests, which could be as obscure as Victorian fashion or as common as math, and explain why and how your topic excites your intellectual curiosity, as well as how you’ll be able to continue learning about it at Haverford. Starting your essay with an anecdote is a great way to show your interest in your topic to readers, rather than simply telling them about it. For example, you could begin by telling the story of how you became interested in art after your first visit to an art museum. Or, you could describe what thoughts and emotions you experience when creating art. Since you’re dealing with a low word count, your story should be pretty simple, as you don’t have the space to flesh out something complicated. The next part of your essay should focus on the deeper reason why you are so interested in your topic or subject. In other words, what specifically about your topic makes you excited to learn more? Maybe you love science because it explains how everything in the world works, from plants growing to playing tennis. Or, maybe you’re passionate about music because it has the power to inspire and connect people. While this essay is a short one, you ideally also want to explain, at least briefly, what you do to satisfy your curiosity about this topic. Do you read every available book on Egyptian pyramids? Do you debate the most successful political campaign strategies with your family at dinner? This extra detail will give your reader a clearer sense of how your interest in your topic manifests on a daily basis, which will make your interest feel more tangible and genuine. Finally, you want to connect your interest in your topic to your potential future as a Haverford student. Hop onto Haverford’s website, and do some research on classes, clubs, or other opportunities at Haverford that will allow you to keep learning about it. Since you probably won’t have much room left by this point, you want to pick just one or two things, as otherwise the end of your essay will feel cramped and rushed. For example, you could talk about how the College Year in Athens study abroad program would deepen your understanding of Greek mythology, by allowing you to see firsthand many of the sites that were most important to the Ancient Greeks. Alternatively, you could write about how the clubs Charcuterie Union and Food for Thought would expand upon your interest in cooking, and help you develop a more comprehensive understanding of the role food can play in different people’s lives.",

        "word_limit": "200",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt tells you pretty much exactly what it wants to know: the values you’re looking for in a college community, and how those values align with Haverford’s. However, while the questions are clear, answering them thoughtfully may take some time, as you’ll need to reflect on what your values truly are. With a question as open-ended as “What do you value in your communities?” sometimes asking yourself related, slightly more focused questions can help you brainstorm more efficiently. Here are some examples of those kinds of questions: What are some of your favorite communities you’re a part of? What makes you love them so much? When you think about your friends, what qualities do many of them share? Look at your complete college list—why are you applying to this particular set of schools, out of all the colleges in the United States and across the world? The actual values you choose are much less important than those values being genuinely important to you. One applicant might write an excellent essay about trust, while someone else might write an equally strong one about open-mindedness. But if you try to force a connection to something that isn’t really one of your primary values, your reader will be able to tell you aren’t being fully authentic. Finally, as you’re brainstorming you’ll likely come up with a list of several different values. But because this essay is so short, you’ll want to focus on just one, or two at the most, once you start writing. Otherwise, you won’t be able to give each value the attention it needs, and your essay will end up feeling all over the place. In your actual essay, the most important thing to do is connect the value or two you’re focusing on to Haverford’s values, specifically those laid out in the Honor Code. If you’re having a hard time doing that, you may want to go back to the drawing board. For example, valuing a good sense of humor is a wonderful thing, but doesn’t connect super well to anything in the Honor Code. A better thing to focus on would be, say, speaking up about what’s important to you. You could easily connect that value to the following two lines of the Honor Code: “The Honor Code allows every student to find and develop their own voice, to practice ways of improving community and acting on issues of importance.” “The Honor Code upholds a culture in which students are deeply trusted to take substantial ownership of their education and to profoundly shape and define the Haverford community.” Once you feel confident that you’ve linked your own values to Haverford’s, you want to think about how to clearly explain that link to admissions officers. Here, Haverford is once again being considerate, and telling you pretty much exactly how they want you to do that, in the second paragraph of the prompt. To summarize, that paragraph is telling you to use concrete examples and anecdotes to explain how you came to have this particular value. In other words, show, don’t tell, because otherwise, your reader won’t really understand what you having this value says about your personality as a whole. Plenty of people value outspokenness, but the point of the college essay is to distinguish yourself from other applicants. So, you want to show what the value you have chosen means in the context of your life specifically, and why that value’s importance in your life has inspired you to apply to Haverford. For example, you could talk about how you hated attention as a kid, and preferred to just spend time with your family’s pets. But during the pandemic, seeing people adopt pets for company without knowing how to take care of them frustrated you to the point that you started your own YouTube channel, to explain how to avoid making common first-time pet owner mistakes. To your surprise, the channel became extremely popular, and many people wrote comments thanking you for your help. Speaking up is still hard for you, though, and being on Haverford’s campus, where outspokenness is encouraged, will help you continue to get better at it. Because this prompt is so explicit about what it wants, it’s pretty hard to get totally off-track. The only thing you really want to be wary of is using your space in an inefficient way. 200 words will disappear quickly, so you want to make sure you’re being thoughtful about how long you spend addressing each part of the prompt. Otherwise, you may end up accidentally using 160 words explaining how you came to have the value you’re focusing on, and then have to cram in the connection to Haverford at the very end. There’s no one correct breakdown of how long you should spend on each point of your essay, as ideally one thing flows naturally into the next. Just make sure the connection to Haverford gets enough room to breathe, as, since that part is likely going to come at the end, it’s at the most risk of getting cut short.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is essentially a “Why This Major?” and “Why This College?” essay combined. Readers are looking to understand which of IU’s programs and opportunities you will take advantage of to further your career. First, discuss your academic and career interests and goals; second, explain how Indiana University specifically would help you reach these aspirations.\n\nThe first part of this essay should ideally answer the question: What do you want to be when you grow up? This part of the essay should present a cohesive picture of your passion in a specific academic field. Start off with a personal anecdote that showcases your interest in a single course of study or future career.\n\nKeep this introduction concise, yet vivid, grasping the reader’s attention. For example, you could begin with a description of performing the oboe in a dark, packed auditorium on a bright stage at the state symphony, or the immense pride and relief you feel after distributing the school newspaper you and your staff worked on for countless hours.\n\nNext, detail your accomplishments and experience in this field — remember to show more than tell. Provide evidence of your interest through your actions during a research project or an extracurricular activity. For example, instead of saying “I like both science and art,” illustrate the year you spent researching the brain’s ability to store memories through Dali’s paintings, and how this caused you to view the process of recollection as more of an art rather than a hard science, leading to your desire to study both neuroscience and art history. Not only does this show your interest in both fields, it also implies you are curious and innovative.\n\nThis paragraph is also a chance to portray your ability to grow and conquer challenges in your given field. So, rather than writing “I won state for Mock Trial,” describe the struggles you overcame and the growth you experienced in your role as president of your school’s mock trial team. By weaving narration throughout the paragraph, you will be able to portray a more authentic and unique story.\n\nLastly, connect your aspirations to IU. Specificity is key here. Avoid being vague and general with sweeping statements like “Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business is perfect for me” or “As a student at IU, I could study abroad.” Vague statements demonstrate a lack of interest and lack of effort. Research and learn about the qualities and programs that make Indiana University unique and special to your needs. What are unique programs or extracurriculars at Indiana University, and what will they teach you? What is a quality of IU that is important to you? Avoid generic responses that could apply to any other university.\n\nIf you want to be an investment banker through Kelley, describe the focused skillset you will gain from the school’s investment banking workshop, or the network you will create from the small classes and tight-knit community of the Kelley Business Honors Program. An aspiring global correspondent could describe the IU’s worldly approach towards learning and interning in London through the Media School’s “Summer in London” program.\n\nYour primary goal is to connect your accomplishments and aspirations with the opportunities that await you at IU; however, avoid listing every possible activity you could participate in and stay focused.\n\nTo review:\n1. Start with a personal, vivid anecdote conveying your interest in a single field.\n2. Share a narrative of you overcoming an obstacle in this field; provide evidence of your experience in this interest.\n3. Describe the essence or quality of a program or activity at IU that would help you grow in this area.",

So, if you are having a hard time coming up with a topic for this prompt, shift to that line of thinking. Here are some examples of less traditional topics that could work: The people you see every day while walking your dog before school, A group sea kayaking trip you did one summer, Your passion for the color purple. The main requirement for your topic is that it has 'contributed to your personal story,' per Hopkins’ request. There is one other thing you want to consider, though. Namely, can you connect this aspect of your identity to one of your goals for Hopkins? Note that this connection doesn’t have to be direct. If your parents immigrated to the United States from Korea, you don’t have to write about wanting to research international migration with Professor Erin Chung. You can, of course, if you genuinely are interested in that line of research. But the connection you make can also be more nuanced. For example, say that some of your relatives are still in Korea and don’t speak English, but you have developed a relationship with them through visits to museums and famous architectural sites, as you have a shared love of art. These experiences have shown you the unifying power of art, which is a phenomenon you’d like to explore more through Hopkins’ Renaissance Art History study abroad program in Florence. Although this connection may not be one your reader was expecting, it works, as this explains it in a clear, easy-to-follow way. Plus, this essay is on the longer side for a supplement. You have 350 words at your disposal, so you have plenty of space to draw more sophisticated connections.",
        "additional_notes": "If you have done a good job of brainstorming, writing the actual essay should be pretty straightforward: you want to describe the aspect of your identity you’re focusing on, and then connect it to the goal you’ve chosen to highlight. The only real rule here is that the connection you’re drawing is explained clearly. If you’re having a hard time with that, maybe take a step back from your essay and come back the next day with a clear head. Sometimes, spending too much time on an essay will bog you down and make it hard to see where to go next. If you’re still having trouble the next day, you might want to return to the brainstorming stage, and either focus on a different aspect of your identity, or connect it to a different goal you have for college. Finally, like with any college essay, your writing will be stronger if you show, rather than tell. That means you want to rely on specific anecdotes and experiences to support your points, as that will make your essay more engaging."

Make sure to mention several logistical characteristics, professors, courses, extracurriculars, etc., and relate them directly to your personal goals. Perhaps you want to conduct research through Lafayette’s EXCEL Scholars program, which will connect you with a professor so you can find STEM mentorship and engage with original scientific literature. Maybe you want to join the Lafayette College Democrats in preparation for your political career. Whatever your passion, the key to this part of answering the prompt is thorough research. Don’t speak about academic offerings in broad terms or name-drop professors for the sake of it. Rather, figure out what is unique to Lafayette’s programming, and tie it back to your own goals and interests. For example, you want to avoid something as simple as the following: “I want to attend Lafayette because they have a good biology department, and I’m interested in the more scientific aspects of medicine.” This is not a good response because it says little to nothing about Lafayette’s actual biology department. While it tells admissions readers a bit about you, it doesn’t indicate that you cared enough about the school to look deeply into its offerings. Instead, try something like: “I look forward to taking BIOL 110 on Edible Ethics, where I will not only explore the science behind food production and consumption, but also the ethical issues surrounding these fields. As an environmentalist and anti-food waste advocate, I hope to gain knowledge from this course that will allow me to engage in concrete change.” This is better because it shows not only that you’ve looked into Lafayette’s offerings, but also that you’ve thought about how that relates to your interests and drawn a clear connection between the two. Additionally, this provides more specificity and substance. You should strive to be as detailed as you can within the word count while also covering all bases that serve as reasons behind your applying to Lafayette.

        "prompt_number": 1,
        "prompt_text": "Macalester is one of few highly selective liberal arts colleges located in the middle of a metropolitan area. Students benefit from the strong sense of community on campus and opportunities to engage in academic, social, and civic engagement options in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Have you thought about how Macalester’s location might impact your experience? If so, in what ways? (300 words)",
        "word_limit": "300 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "As you begin to dissect the prompt above, you will notice that it’s essentially asking why you want to attend Macalester, focusing your response on the opportunities surrounding the college’s metropolitan location. This means that while you may elaborate on why Macalester’s unique campus culture, traditions, courses, professors, or other (academic or non-academic) opportunities attract you to the college, you should relate each reason to Macalester’s location in particular. Now, you may be saying, 'Wait, I thought I shouldn’t mention location in a “Why This College” essay, since that’s a general feature that can apply to many other schools?' Generally speaking, that’s correct, but this prompt goes outside the box by asking specifically how you plan to interact with the surrounding off-campus community. So, you should definitely mention location, but, like in any other 'Why This College?' essay, be sure to also describe how you will engage with the opportunities available because of Macalester in particular. For example, if you’re interested in education or community outreach, you could mention your interest in Macalester’s Opportunities Abound: A Partnership for College Access Program (which ensures that local, low-income high school students in the Twin Cities have access to the information they need in order to make an informed decision regarding their futures). Alternatively, if you are interested in the environment and sustainability, you could mention your interest in engaging with the organization Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy in Minneapolis during your free time in order to supplement your academic studies with impactful action. For any 'Why This College' essay, your goal is to convince the admissions officer that their school is the best fit for you, by intertwining your reasons for applying with your unique background and motivations. Therefore, it’s crucial that the reasons you provide for wanting to attend Macalester are school-specific. Generally, the more specific you can be, the more likely you are to seem genuinely interested and well-researched. If you’ve been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to visit Macalester before writing your application, drawing on your own memories and experiences from your visit is a great way of enriching your essay. For example, you could talk about how the friendliness of the teenagers you asked for directions in the Twin Cities inspired your interest in the 'Opportunities Abound' program mentioned above. If you haven’t yet had the opportunity to visit campus, you can also strengthen your essay by researching Macalester’s core values, and ensuring that the values and traits you reveal about yourself are aligned with the college’s core values. Simply put, doing a little research (or just checking out the values already listed in Prompt 2!) can help you avoid emphasizing misaligned values in your essay, which risks potentially alienating admissions officers. For example, Macalester College places a strong emphasis on multiculturalism, so writing an essay on the importance of nationalism may not make the impact you’re planning. Instead, perhaps you want to study displaced populations in college, and you specifically want to learn more about how refugees integrate into American life. Minneapolis is home to the world’s first Somali culture museum, which would be a perfect place to delve into the stories of this displaced group. Writing about this would align with Macalester’s value of multiculturalism. In addition to not aligning your own value’s with Macalester’s, another thing you want to avoid is listing the college’s various accolades, or generic traits like a low student-to-faculty ratio—your response must be both specific to the school and personal to you to be effective. Also keep in mind that supplemental essays should complement, not merely rehash, your main Common App essay, so make sure you’re providing new information to admissions officers. While this prompt may seem a bit daunting at first, due to the unconventional angle into the 'Why This College?' question, this essay should not be a cause for stress. Just think carefully about the reasons that you want to attend Macalester, and then, frame each reason with the college’s location near the Twin Cities.",

Guided by this mission, Macalester is a learning environment that affirms different identities and experiences and prepares graduates to work toward a more just and peaceful world. In what ways do your lived experiences, perspectives, or hopes for your college education connect with Macalester’s mission/learning environment? (300 words)",
        "word_limit": "300 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "You may notice that this is a version of the common diversity essay. So, to brainstorm, you want to consider which aspects of your identity are most important to who you are. Aspects of identity can include traditional markers such as ethnicity/race, gender, country of origin, and language. But don’t feel limited to those—your identity also includes things like your hometown, income class/socioeconomic status, illnesses/disabilities, and even interests and activities. In your response, you’ll want to show how the aspect you focus on will allow you to uniquely contribute to Macalester’s community. A quick note if you intend to write about your racial background: in June 2023, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling, however, still allows colleges to consider race on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts in their supplemental essay packages. So, if you feel that your racial background has impacted you significantly, this is a good place to talk about that, since schools are now legally banned from factoring your race into their decision in any other context. Regardless of whether you write about your race or something else, remember to show, not tell—sharing an anecdote is the best way to bring your story to life. Think about times when your chosen trait was particularly relevant to your growth. For example, if you were raised in a family that blended multiple cultures, you might talk about how your grandparents visited from Pakistan every summer and gave you clothing as a gift, which helped you stay connected to their culture over the years. Finally, the prompt specifically asks you to connect your life experiences to Macalester’s mission or learning environment, so do research on Macalester’s website to find things that resonate with you. For the above example, you could talk about how receiving gifts from your grandparents showed you the importance of making a concerted effort to connect with other cultures, so you will make sure to go out of your way to engage with your Macalester peers who come from different backgrounds than you. Things to avoid: Complaining. While discrimination and negativity may be a part of your experience as part of a specific identity group, you don’t want to use this space solely to complain about experiences you’ve had. Frame your experiences as growth opportunities. Discriminating against other communities and identities. This is an opportunity for you to showcase what’s important and unique about you. There is no need to put other people down in order to tell your story. Simply listing aspects of your identity. Writing a list of traits without any elaboration will make your essay read like a generic laundry list. Choosing a clichéd topic like an immigrant story or traveling/moving. While these experiences may have been incredibly formative for you, they’re also some of the most overused tropes in college admissions, so it’s hard to make yourself truly stand out if you write about one of them.",

If you choose to answer this question, you can set yourself up for success with these tips: Be as direct and concise as possible. In some cases, grade fluctuations are due to factors outside your control, such as health or family issues. Explaining how these situations impacted your grades should be fairly straightforward. Or, perhaps you wanted a challenge and overextended yourself by signing up for too many AP classes or extracurriculars. Be careful not to make excuses. Admissions officers do not want to hear that you ended up with a C in Algebra II your junior year because you got that math teacher everyone hated. You never want to suggest that your poor performance in a class was someone else’s fault, as that may make admissions officers think you lack accountability. Show that you have grown and remained resilient. Instead of blaming teachers for your bad grades, a much better approach is to talk about how you remained positive, embraced the challenges presented to you, and ultimately learned from the experience. While we’d all love to apply to college with a perfect GPA, most of us don’t have that, and showing that you can respond to challenges in a mature, growth-oriented way can ultimately strengthen your application.",

Demonstrates your passion for the major that you have chosen.\n2. Integrates your past and present studies and interests seamlessly with your future at MIT and your long-term academic and professional goals.\n3. Addresses specifically why MIT—the campus, resources, faculty, programs, and opportunities—is the place where you need and want to study.\nBefore you start brainstorming and drafting a response to this prompt, spend ample time exploring the various majors on MIT’s website.

This key phrase means that if you matriculate at MIT, you will in no way be required to major in the field of study that you write about in response to this prompt. You are free to choose and change your major, and most students change their major at least once during their college career.\nFor anyone who has many interests, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to choose just one major to write about. It is completely fine, and even expected, that you may be undecided, but spend time condensing your list of potential majors to one or two that you are truly interested in pursuing further.\nThis straightforward prompt requires a concise response since it has only a 100-word limit. While specificity is still important, there is less space for detail than in the other 200 word prompts that MIT asks you to write. Once you have introduced the field of study that most appeals to you, you will need to discuss why this field appeals to you. The reasons that you give need to be authentic reasons; they should be based on pure intellectual curiosity, personal goals, and strongly held values. Avoid listing prestige, post-graduation salary, or your parents’ desires as reasons for choosing your major or MIT. The admissions committee wants to know what you are genuinely passionate about and why.",

Do you love reading because you enjoy imagining yourself in fictional worlds? Do you find peace in painting natural scenery? Now is a great time to describe these experiences. What makes each of these examples strong is the employment of imagery and sensory details.

Don’t tell them that you love photography, show them that you love it by transforming your answer into a story. Be honest — don’t lie for the sake of sounding more impressive.",

Did you start or participate in clubs that fostered understanding among diverse students? What was your motivation for doing so, and were you successful?

Did you participate in discussions, presentations, or papers that promoted these ideals? Research: Have you conducted research on issues like racial equality, social justice, or community service? How did your findings contribute to promoting Dr. King’s vision? Service: What volunteer work or community service have you done that aligns with the ideals of the “Beloved Community”? How did your actions directly contribute to fostering a more just and loving society?

Impact: Highlight the impact of your work. How did your actions contribute to a positive change in your community or field of study? Notice that each point can seamlessly lead into the next to establish a good narrative flow. Begin with anecdotes, examples, and details about the experiences you’ve had.

        "word_limit": "300-500",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is essentially a “why this school” essay, but with an emphasis on the religious aspects of the school. To write this essay, you’ll need to have a grasp on how your faith fits into your life so that you can discuss what you’ll bring to Pepperdine. The first part of this prompt, however, is much simpler: why are you interested in attending Pepperdine? The more specific you are, the more genuine your interest seems. The best way to do this is to find a few aspects of Pepperdine that appeal to you, like programs and clubs, and describe why those are important to you. For example: Your involvement with your church at home might lead you to want to continue that kind of work at college, and the Student-Led Ministry Service would appeal to you. If you’re passionate about filmmaking—and maybe incorporating your faith with your film—you might be interested in the Sundance IGNITE club, where you can learn how to prepare for a film career. Students interested in pursuing a career in law might be interested in the Certificate in Conflict Management, where they could enroll in courses in Pepperdine’s law school to supplement their undergraduate classes. You’ll have to do some research into Pepperdine to find specific programs—whether academic or not—that interest you. If possible, try to incorporate your faith into at least one of these programs, like the Student-Led Ministries, since the prompt specifically notes that Pepperdine is a Christian university. The second half of the prompt is how you’ll contribute to conversations of faith on campus. This is a little more complicated, but there are several ways you could think about it. What unique religious experiences have you gone through that caused the development of your perspectives? Did you turn to faith after some sort of trauma, like a death in the family or a serious injury? Did you travel to a place where you had the opportunity to delve deep into your connection to religion? Do you have a unique way of practicing your religion? Pepperdine is a Christian university, but perhaps you feel that you can better understand Christianity by learning about and engaging with other religions. Maybe you’re fairly new to religion and still questioning and challenging—your contributions to conversations might be very different from those of other students, but you would be able to push people to think about things in a way they hadn’t before. You might not be a Christian at all, but your experiences with a different religion might allow you to engage in more thoughtful conversations about the differences in faiths and beliefs. Overall, the way you contribute to conversations of faith is really a commentary on how your faith is a part of you. It’s how you think about or practice your faith. You can also refer back to the programs and groups at Pepperdine that appeal to you. There, you could bring your faith and beliefs to the student body. By pointing that out, Pepperdine can see that you’ve thought about how to combine your faith with your life on campus. The ultimate point of this essay is to show Pepperdine that you are genuinely interested in the school and have put some thought into how your faith will fit in with the Pepperdine community at large. You’ll accomplish this by pointing out specific details about both Pepperdine and your unique perspective on faith, which will show us how you plan to find your place at the school.",

As agents of change, our students utilize these values to create solutions to our world’s challenges. Please choose from the following prompts and answer below:",
        "word_limit": "300-650 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Option A: Describe what you are looking for from your college experience and why Pitzer would be a good fit for you. This “Why This College?” prompt is a great choice for applicants who are really excited for a liberal arts college experience. Broadly speaking, liberal arts colleges pride themselves on producing well-rounded graduates who have both the qualitative and quantitative tools to understand and analyze events around them. Pitzer specifically prides itself on educating 'engaged, socially responsible citizens of the world.' If you see college as a place to grow and become a positively contributing member of society, then this essay is just the place for you to express that vision. Your goal, in this essay, should be to show who specifically you hope to become through your college education. This can mean a number of things—from mapping out the skills or knowledge you hope to gain to describing the social bonds you’d like to form, and from talking about the broad contributions you want to make in the world to stating the specific career path you’d like to pursue. Below, we’ll dig into ways to personalize your response to this very broad question. Selecting a Topic: In general, brainstorming for this essay will have two parts: you’ll need to think about what you want from your college experience, and then you’ll need to research and decide on which of Pitzer’s resources best support that goal. We’ll go through both these phases below! Phase 1: Thinking about what you want from your college experience. As you begin to think about what you’re looking for from your college experience, it’s a good idea to organize the results of your brainstorming. One way to do this is to categorize the benefits you’re looking for from your college education. Below we’ve listed four types of goals that you could have for your college education. Academic knowledge and skills, Social experiences and connections, Self-knowledge, Career advancement. There are, of course, other goals you might have, too, but using these categories can help organize your essay. A focused, strong response to this prompt will likely: Focus on just one or two—or at most three—of the areas listed above. Home in on your specific interests within each category. Link those interests to your broader goals to create a compelling, holistic picture of who you are. Phase 2: Thinking about Pitzer’s resources. Once you’ve decided on your goals for college, you should research which features of Pitzer will help you create your ideal college experience. As you do this research, keep these pointers in mind: Go beyond what you’ll find in one or two clicks on Pitzer’s website. Though it’s fine to write about easily findable resources, be sure to do a deeper research dive, too. Link these resources to what you’re looking for from college. For example, if you want to gain research experience in college, a natural choice might be to write about a biology research opportunity. However, don’t just write: 'I’m excited about Pitzer’s biology research opportunities.' Instead, explain what labs you want to work in, faculty mentors you want to collaborate with, or particular topics you want to investigate and associated questions you’d like to answer. You could even give examples of current ongoing research that links to your interests. Describing specific programs and their offerings always shows that you’ve done your due diligence when it comes to getting to know what a college has to offer. Be sure to explain what specific skills or insights you’ll gain from research at Pitzer. Avoid writing about common college resources in general terms. Along similar lines as our previous point, if you’re writing about an opportunity or resource that most colleges and universities offer, be sure to explain why this resource is distinct and especially exciting at Pitzer. For example: Almost all liberal arts colleges have an English major. If you’re excited to pursue an English major at Pitzer, be sure to highlight what makes their program stand out—and how it will help you achieve your specific goals. The resources you mention could be anything from creative writing workshops to particular faculty members to specific student groups affiliated with the department. Some college applicants have clear academic or professional goals, while other students want to explore new areas in college in order to decide on an academic or professional path. Regardless of whether you already have concrete long-term goals or not, this prompt could work well for you. However, you will need to find a way to make more speculative or vague goals feel detailed, personal, and compelling.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This community service prompt is a great choice for applicants who are particularly excited about one of Pitzer’s core values. The phrasing of this prompt may seem like you’re being asked to write about a whole period of your life or general community involvement. However, the strongest responses will focus in on particular 'moments' or 'experiences' to show: That you have thought deeply about the core value in question, and That you actually live out or engage with this value in your daily life. Though it might be tempting to try to show how you live out this value in many different parts of your life, or over the whole course of your whole high school career, a more focused essay will be more compelling. Trying to write an essay that surveys your entire high school career will likely prove stressful and counterproductive, as four years cannot fit into 650 words! Selecting a Topic: Remember that this essay is ultimately about you and your engagement with one of Pitzer’s values. This means that clubs or activities that you were only involved in as a member or infrequent participant might not be the best choice. Though essays about teamwork or group activities can absolutely be strong, your own voice and role should be clear. For example, if you want to write about environmental sustainability, you might be choosing between writing about your membership in your school’s sustainability club and a project that you started at your grandmother’s nursing home to reduce food waste. Here, the project you initiated at your grandmother’s nursing home would be a better choice, because it shows your own vision and motivation, rather than describing your more engagement as one member (even if you’re an active member) of a school club. Finally, remember to avoid the temptation to fit all the times you’ve engaged with Pitzer’s values into one essay.",

Pitzer is known for valuing creativity and activism, so your response should reflect a distinct, personal way of thinking about contemporary issues–note that Pitzer says explicitly your project does not have to be academic. Brainstorming Questions: What social or political issues are you passionate about? Is there a specific community or group you want to help? What is your motivation for being invested in this issue? Do you have personal experiences related to it? How can your talents and skills contribute to this cause? Do you have artistic, academic, or leadership skills that could be useful? Have you already done any work related to this issue that you could build on? What type of project would you want to create? A community event, a research project, an artistic piece, or something else? How would this project bring attention to or solve the issue? How would you measure the impact of your project? What changes or outcomes would you like to see as a result of your work? Who would be involved in or benefit from your project? How does this project align with Pitzer’s values of social responsibility, intercultural understanding, and environmental sustainability? What aspects of Pitzer’s mission resonate with your project? What Makes a Good Response: Personal Connection: Demonstrate why this cause matters to you. With 650 words, you have room to provide background context, through a personal story or experience, that will make your desire to solve this issue more compelling. Specific and Feasible Project: Clearly outline your project, including the steps you would take and the resources you would use. A detailed plan shows that you appreciate the scope of the cause you’ve chosen, and have thought deeply about how you could contribute to it. Creativity and Originality: Pitzer values innovative thinking. Propose a project that reflects your unique perspective and talents. For example, rather than just saying you want to work with local officials to incorporate more green spaces into your city, describe how you’d harness your excellent baking abilities to create a new map of the city for them, made out of cupcakes. Connection to Pitzer: Explain how you would use Pitzer’s resources to drive your project forward, or how the environment of the school would support your endeavors. Impact: Highlight the potential outcomes of your project, including who would benefit from it. You want admissions officers to see how your work would lead to tangible, meaningful change.",

When colleges have this kind of prompt, they want to know about your own personal background and how it has influenced your worldview and perspectives. Even though you don’t have to respond, we strongly encourage you to do so. Pitzer is a highly selective school, which means you want to take advantage of any extra opportunity you have to share yourself with admissions officers. You never know what could be the difference maker! Before you get started, a quick note if you’re thinking of writing about your racial background. In June 2023, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling, however, still allows colleges to consider race on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts as one of their supplemental essay prompts. If you feel that your racial background has impacted you significantly, this is the place to discuss that, as otherwise schools will be legally unable to factor your race into their admissions decision. The traditional approach to this kind of prompt is describing what you think is the most important part of your identity, then briefly discussing how that aspect of diversity is relevant to you and your general life experiences. Such a response might be written about one of the following scenarios: Using your fluency in another language to help members of a specific community. Interpreting a text in class differently from your classmates because of your ethnic culture. Having a friend of a different background who has changed your perspective on something important. Having an illness or disability that helps you view accessibility through a different lens than your peers. Being part of a niche interest group/fandom and trying to represent the group faithfully when talking to people who aren’t members of it. Simply listing things that people typically associate with diversity should be avoided. Sure, diversity includes different ethnicities/races, gender identities, sexual orientations, countries of origin, and languages, but writing out a laundry list of how you identify within each of those categories will make your essay feel like a census report, not a personal reflection. Instead, highlight just one thing you feel is especially important, and really let Pitzer’s admissions officers inside your head so they can understand how this particular aspect of your identity has shaped your growth and development. Also, bear in mind that the traditional markers of diversity aren’t the only ones you can discuss. There are other aspects of identity that can make a campus community diverse, including socioeconomic classes, hometowns, illnesses/disabilities, and even interests or hobbies. Once you have chosen your aspect of background or identity, describe how it has influenced you and your life. Often, the best way to do this is through a meaningful anecdote. As you brainstorm formative life experiences related to this aspect of your identity, think about the following questions for each experience: What happened? What was going through your mind and how did you feel as it happened? How have your emotions about the event changed over time? Have you faced any challenges as a result of membership in this community or your background?",

That freedom, combined with a pretty long word count, means that the brainstorming process is crucial to writing a strong response. If you don’t already have a clear sense of what you want to say, your essay may end up all over the place. One good way to focus your brainstorming is through the prompt’s attention to conversations. You’re likely going to share similar things with your peers at Princeton as you do with your friends and family right now. So, questions like the following may help you start figuring out what you want to write about: Which stories do you tell most often? When you meet someone new, what are some of the first things you usually talk about? When you give advice, which experiences do you draw on? Hopefully, thinking through these slightly more targeted questions will give you some ideas about what you might want to include in your essay. Remember, you have space to work with here, so you don’t have to zero in on just one thing like you would for a shorter prompt. That being said, you also want to make sure that your essay is organized, so you also don’t want to be trying to fit in ten different things. Rather, select one experience, or 2-4 experiences that are clearly related, to use as the foundation for your essay. Once you have a general structure for your essay, you can then connect bigger picture takeaways to it, which ensures that your essay is cohesive. For example, maybe you choose to focus your essay on an ice fishing trip you took with your grandfather, and the lessons you learned about patience and the value of cross-generational relationships. Alternatively, you could write about your tradition of getting an owl-themed trinket anywhere you go on vacation, and how this small, seemingly silly routine has given you something consistent across different periods of your life. As noted above, for this prompt, brainstorming is more than half the battle. If you have a clear game plan before you start writing, actually getting the words down will hopefully be more about finding the right phrasing and crafting smooth transitions than actually generating content. You do want to make sure that, like in any college essay, you’re utilizing the “show, don’t tell” strategy. In other words, rather than telling something to your reader directly, describe a moment or situation that illustrates the point you’re trying to make. To see the benefits of this approach, compare the following two excerpts from hypothetical essays: Excerpt 1: “For as long as I can remember, I’ve collected owl trinkets on family vacations. In 2009, I got my first one, a ceramic burrowing owl from Tucson, Arizona. The most recent addition to my collection was a dense, bronze owl from Athens, who I was especially excited about since owls are the symbol of Athena, the patron goddess of that city.” Excerpt 2: “As my family enters the small, dimly lit shop at the end of one of Athens’s many winding streets, my eyes immediately lock onto the shelves upon shelves of owls. Huge, marble ones that cost hundreds of euros, and tiny, wooden ones as spindly as a toothpick. After much deliberation, I select a dense bronze fellow who is barely an inch high. I can already envision how he’ll look on my desk at home, lined up next to all the other owls I’ve collected over the years.” These two excerpts give us basically the same information, but the first presents it to us in a very dry, factual way. The second, on the other hand, drops us right next to the writer as they pick out their latest owl, and includes vivid descriptions that make this excerpt much more engaging to read. Particularly since you have 500 words at your disposal, you should see this essay as an opportunity to show off your creative writing ability with a stylistic flourish here and there. That being said, in your early drafts, don’t focus on this kind of finer detail. Make sure you have a personal, informative, cohesive essay first, then take the time to add the cherries on top later. As we hinted at in the brainstorming section above, the biggest potential pitfall with this essay is that between the open-ended prompt and the high word count, you may end up adrift, without any clear focus point to anchor you. To avoid that happening, don’t just rattle off a bunch of vague, Hallmark card lessons. Instead, follow the strategies laid out in the previous two sections to ensure that the points you make are clearly connected to your own personal experiences. The other thing you want to be sure to avoid is repeating information that can already be found elsewhere in your application, namely in your Common App essay. If you already wrote about your owl collection there, you want to pick something else to focus on here. You only get so many opportunities to share your personality with Princeton’s admissions officers, so don’t waste one by telling them things they already know.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Keep in mind that the keyword is “story”—this prompt is not an invitation to list all of your achievements in community service as you will on your resume. Rather, Princeton is asking for a deeply held part of your identity through which you’re motivated to perform civic engagement and service. We’ll cover some specific points below, but we also have a detailed blog post on writing service essays that you’ll find useful as well. Also note that this prompt is a bit more focused on Princeton itself, so devote about 30-40% of your writing to specific programs at Princeton that align with your interests. We always recommend spending a good hour snooping around a college’s website, clicking through links and looking at the different clubs, classes, programs, institutes, and communities. Also check out Princeton’s webpages for service and civic engagement. A trusty table can be of good help while you brainstorm: Ideal, My story, Princeton. Focus on one interest or concern. Here, less is more—focusing on one key experience or aspect of your identity shows more thought and effort than copying and pasting several experiences. And for this prompt, it’s most effective to focus on the service work about which you can write the most and or to which you can relate the most. For instance, a student wanting to study literature might help make sandwiches for charity every month, but she probably has a more immediate connection to being a weekly reader and Bible study leader at her church. Don’t turn your brain on autopilot or regurgitate the prompt. This prompt uses a lot of “admissions-speak,” which should serve as a signpost to direct you, not as suggested wording to include in your response. “Intersect,” for example, has become an important—but increasingly robotic—buzzword in recent years. Try to avoid repeating it, and instead opt for words with more emotional resonance: “find a home [at Princeton],” “delve into the research [at Princeton],” etc. The same goes for “service” and “civic engagement”—repeat them too much and you’ll start to sound like you’re using the prompt as a crutch. Besides, there are more vivid words at your disposal. As always, be specific. Pick not just a broad issue (“helping the homeless”), but also a subset of the issue that actually seems manageable (“making sure that the homeless have access to Internet and library services”). From there, look for potential classes offered at Princeton, and student organizations involved in similar missions. It may be worth citing current student activism projects you find on Princeton’s website, and discussing how those same opportunities would allow you to apply your skills in the best way for you personally.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This essay is only required for those who have indicated on their application an interest in pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. The key here is to be specific; an implicit aspect of this question is “Why Princeton engineering? What makes Princeton’s engineering program different from other programs? Why would this be a better fit for you than any other?” In essence, this is sort of like the common “Why This Major?” prompt, but it’s referring to a specialized program rather than a specific major. Rather than vaguely discussing the reasons that Princeton’s engineering program is something you wish to be a part of, mention specific resources and appeal to the philosophy of an engineering education. For instance, if there’s a particular class that interests you, don’t be afraid to directly mention it and connect the class back to your overall interest in engineering. Extracurricular programs are another area you should definitely mention. If you’re passionate about sustainability, you could discuss your interest in the Princeton chapter of Engineers Without Borders, commenting on how you will use your membership to promote sustainable engineering. If you enjoy working with kids, perhaps Princeton Engineering Education for Kids is more appealing. No matter your interests, be sure to mention a club or organization that could allow you to pursue these interests outside of the classroom. If you have a preferred area of specialization, such as bioengineering or chemical engineering, it would be great if you’re able to tie this back to your current passions or activities. Maybe you’re already involved in an organization at your current school that deals with these more specialized areas of engineering. If so, make sure to emphasize this, as that would allow your passion to shine through and showcase previous relevant experience. Be warned, however, that listing all your engineering related activities can make your essay sound like a resume. Rather than simply providing a list, connect each activity to each other in order to construct a more cohesive essay. Make sure that any change in topic flows smoothly from one to the next to avoid transforming your essay into a laundry list of your achievements. Another direction that you might take when discussing previous engineering experience is to discuss your state of mind when partaking in these activities. Perhaps working on complex engineering problems gets your adrenaline pumping, or maybe you find it quite therapeutic and relaxing. It’s always a good idea to show the admissions officers how you feel when partaking in subjects or activities you’re passionate about. As always, remember to show Princeton another piece of yourself by highlighting your passions, interests, and goals, and by connecting these back to Princeton’s academic environment.",

        "word_limit": "250",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "The primary purpose of this prompt is for you to pinpoint specific programs at Purdue and explain why they will further your interests and goals. In other words, this is the typical “Why This College” essay. First, consider your interests and your goals for college. These could be academic, like an interest in British literature or a goal of becoming a prominent Alzheimer’s researcher. They could be cultural—maybe you are particularly interested in finding a Latinx community on campus. Your interests and goals could even be social, like wanting to find a tight-knit group of friends, or more specific to your person, like knowing the importance of guidance for yourself and hoping to find a strong faculty mentor. After you’ve identified what is important to you, research Purdue and find the unique programs, opportunities, and resources that will help you pursue your specific interests and goals. By connecting your interests to your desire to attend Purdue, you will do two important things: tell admissions officers about yourself and convince them that Purdue is the right place for you. The offerings that you reference should be unique to Purdue and should not be able to be copied and pasted for any other university. Some examples could include: A student from a small town in rural California mentioning the appeal of Purdue’s emphasis on traditions and camaraderie by referencing the “Hello Walk,” where everyone is encouraged to greet each other with a smile. An engineering student discussing how their childhood obsession with Neil Armstrong developed into a passion for all things aerospace, then transitioning to discuss the resources at Purdue’s i2i Learning Laboratory. A political science student who spearheaded their high school’s mock trial team discussing the Butler Center for Leadership Excellence. Connecting your interests in general to your interest in Purdue will also help you avoid the common mistake of focusing too much on either one of these two facets. In terms of structure, here is a general outline: Introduction (1-2 sentences) You most likely won’t need much space to introduce your response here. An example of a good introductory sentence would be “My friends call me a political junkie.” This is a concise statement that allows the writer to pick out different programs at Purdue University that relate to politics and explain their value. Don’t do this: “Purdue is a great school with a plethora of organizations I want to join.” This sentence is 14 words long, but it adds nothing to the response following it. Body (7-10 sentences) The sentence count here isn’t exact since it largely depends on how long your sentences are. In this section, you need to answer the question point-blank. One useful strategy here is to couple specific programs with descriptions of how they relate to your interests. Strive to alternate between the two. Here are some examples: “I’ve made a lot of friends in my school choir and want to form new bonds through music in college, so I hope to join Purdue Soundtracks.” “I want to study the effects of pesticides on crops under Professor Adrian. This will enable me to pursue a career as an organic agricultural specialist.” (Side note: Don’t mention a specific professor for the sake of name-dropping them; only do so if you are very familiar with their work) “I want to join the Honors College so that I can be surrounded by like-minded peers while I pursue my Scholarly Project—writing a full-form novel.” You can divide the body into multiple paragraphs here, with each paragraph focusing on a different aspect of your goals and how the school can support them. In 250 words, you’ll likely be able to talk about 3-4 goals/resources, centered around 1-2 themes. For example, the political junkie student might be passionate about the environment and using policy to enact change. They may want to major in Political Science with a minor in Environmental Policy and Politics. They can also take advantage of the department’s Job-Ready Awards, which provide funding for low-paid or unpaid internships, so they can intern with a local environmental nonprofit. Outside of the classroom, they may want to join the Richard Petticrew Forum to enhance their public speaking and debate skills, particularly in policy debate. It will also help them find community in a new place, as they grew really close to their debate teammates in high school. They also look forward to joining the Environmental Science Club, where they can participate in local conservationism and outdoor activities, staying true to their rural roots. Conclusion (1 sentence) The conclusion is the most skippable part of this supplement. Only make a closing remark if it is powerful and gives the essay a greater sense of overall cohesion. Don’t bother with it if you maximized your word count and are having a lot of trouble cutting your essay down to fit in a concluding sentence. Good example: “Purdue’s ample interdisciplinary resources will help me grow as a politically-active conservationist.” Don’t do this: “All of these programs will make my Purdue experience truly one of a kind.” This is a sweet sentiment, but it’s just adding extra words. Instead, begin the last interest/program pairing with a transition like “finally” to signal the end of the essay.",

        "word_limit": "250",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is the classic “Why This Major?” question. The goal with this prompt is multifold—you must explain what compelled your choice of major and demonstrate that you understand what your major involves moving forward, while also helping the admissions officer learn about who you are and what you value. Multiple experiences probably culminated in you selecting your major, but because of this prompt’s word limit, you won’t be able to give the full history. Instead, focus on what motivated you most directly. It is often helpful to frame your major selection within the context of one or two activities, classes, or experiences. Additionally, describing specific turning points in your education (both in and out of class) can lead to a concise and engaging essay. Here are some examples: You had a medical internship where you witnessed a surgeon conduct heart surgery. Watching the surgery inspired your long-term goal of attending medical school and saving lives. Thus, you want to major in biology with a pre-med concentration. You always hated math until you got to AP Calculus. You couldn’t believe it at first, but when you caught yourself thinking about velocity graphs while driving, you knew you had discovered your true passion. Growing up, you were a huge tennis fan. You loved playing and idolized the pros, but it broke your heart whenever any of them would get injuries. That’s why you want to major in sports medicine and eventually work alongside them at the ATP World Tour. You felt so inspired by your first Model UN conference that you just knew you had to go into diplomacy and international relations. You began reading official UN resolutions in your spare time. If you write about a turning point, make sure you use it to characterize yourself (to show the readers that you are a real-life human). The student who wants to go to medical school might mention that they are super compassionate because they have three younger siblings who they take care of. The student who loves math might explain how they identify as a logical thinker in all aspects of life. The IR student might explain that they always got in trouble for arguing as a kid, but over time learned to communicate effectively and it changed their life. The ultimate goal of college essays is to tell admissions officers something about you—your values, your personality, what gets you excited, why you are the way you are. The more in touch with yourself, the better. It is not enough to simply mention your involvement in something. Depth is better than breadth.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Before starting an honors essay, it is important to do some research on the program. Of course, all honors programs look for students with top marks and demonstrated passion for their studies, but each program is also looking for a specific type of student, who thinks in a specific way. Purdue describes their ideal student as committed to the Honors College’s four pillars: leadership development, undergraduate research, community and global experiences, and interdisciplinary academics. First things first, don’t get overwhelmed by this heightened word count. Having more words will give you more opportunities to expand on your thoughts. That being said, be wary. If you don’t use your words wisely, you run the risk of writing a boring essay. To avoid this, try incorporating examples, anecdotes, and a unique voice into your writing. If you simply divide your 500 words between the four pillars (125 words/pillar, 1 experience/pillar), your essay will not be very engaging. Consider identifying one vision, idea, or goal for your honors experience, then using imagery and creativity to show that vision, and connecting the four pillars of the Honors College back to that image. Your image could emphasize 1) how the four pillars guided you in the past or 2) how the four pillars will guide you in the future—just make sure you tie it back to Purdue! Looking Back Because the prompt does ask about Purdue, if you are going to use an anecdote from the past, it should be used as an avenue to predict the future. Your outline would be something like: An engaging introduction or “hook” Your anecdote from the past, which shows your commitment to the four pillars Reflection on how the past anecdote shows your values and their alignment with the four pillars A prediction of how your values would play out in the Purdue Honors College. Examples of high school experiences that align with the four pillars: You founded a club at your high school for international students and domestic students to come together after seeing that the foreign exchange students were having trouble finding a community and also noticing that they had unique thoughts and values that could help domestic students. You took AP Capstone Research and had an unofficial leadership role on your team. Your team researched the interactions between sociocultural factors and the outputs of job prediction quizzes and algorithms. You wrote a science fiction short story that incorporated your knowledge of physics and your passion for literature, then started a group for science fiction writers at your local library. Looking Forward If you don’t have a strong high school anecdote, you can simply create a vivid image of the future. Get creative! You can imagine specific scenarios, with you in specific locations on campus. You can even make up dialogue or predict potential struggles you might have. Examples of experiences you could anticipate that align with the four pillars: Forging friendships with students from different cultures and backgrounds as a leader in an organization on campus like the Beta Psi Omega or the Native American Educational and Cultural Center. Researching in a lab that incorporates cultural factors into AI development and building a strong relationship with your professor. Studying abroad in Bhutan to work with Bhutanese college students to explore overlaps between animal rights, environmental and agricultural concerns, and biology when dealing with the Big Cats of the Himalayas. Volunteering at a community center in West Lafayette to install current water purifying technology, then staying after and teaching the children about the fundamentals of chemical engineering and sustainability. No matter the approach you choose, make sure this essay stays engaging and demonstrates your personal alignment with the values of the Purdue Honors College.

You have to prove that you see the connectedness of academics—that you believe your field affects others fields and other fields affect yours! The main challenge of this prompt is identifying a convincing and interesting connection. If you are a naturally interdisciplinary thinker, think about your other interests and how you have applied them to your studies in the past. You can draw together very different fields: Drawing and medicine come together through medical illustrators. Medicine and public policy come together through public health (NIH, NCI, NIA). Literature and healthcare come together through narrative medicine. Music and cinema come together through film scoring. On the other hand, if you are exclusively science-minded or arts-minded (one of those people who says “I don’t have a [creative/scientific] bone in my body”), you may want to focus on the perspective that a different, but related discipline can contribute to your studies. These essays identify the importance of nuanced interdisciplinary fields and will explicitly reproach the fact that similar disciplines do not learn from each other. Examples: A biology student who isn’t super creative could talk about how neuroscience researchers often neglect the value of qualitative research and could benefit from incorporating human subjectivity into their research practices like psychology researchers do. A student who draws might describe how drawing could benefit from the layering techniques that painters use. If you are completely stuck for ideas, you should try to narrow your scope. A field of study is a large topic. Something like environmental engineering can be divided into research, manufacturing, applications, innovation, and more. Focusing on a subtopic may help you to see overlap with other disciplines. For example, environmental engineering research connects with public policy because research is often funded through government subsidies and grants. On the other hand, environmental engineering manufacturing relates to business and management. Start with your “chosen field of study.” Think about what you are interested in within that field. Then: Think about what affects the subcategory you are interested in. Consider how the subcategory is funded. Try to draw parallels between your subcategory and other disciplines. Identify the most unrelated field you can think of and try to connect it to your discipline. Make a list of the things that a professional in your field considers on a daily basis. After you have identified a topic, writing this essay should not be terribly challenging. Be articulate as you describe the connections between your chosen disciplines—just because something connects in your mind, doesn’t mean it will connect for your readers. Provide tangible examples, if they exist, to make the connections clear. Come up with hypothetical situations where your disciplines would interact—fictional stories and hypothetical anecdotes will make your essay more engaging! Additionally, in a long and idea-heavy essay like this one, you should try to incorporate a distinct voice and a unique writing style. Honors programs are small and close-knit, so you want the admissions officers to enjoy your writing and desire to know you.",

This involves things that aren’t physical, such as values. Does RPI or a specific program within it care about interdisciplinarity, environmental justice, religious faith, or intellectual creativity? See if you can find a program or group within RPI that resonates with you on many levels. Once you have accumulated a list of unique things about RPI that interest you, narrow it down to 2-3 points that really stand out, so you can elaborate more within 250 words. Share your goals and then explicitly show how those resources make RPI the perfect environment for you.",

The first step for this essay is identifying which extracurricular or work experience you wish to discuss. As the college will see your list of extracurricular activities and awards in the application, it doesn’t necessarily have to be your most impressive extracurricular. The most interesting and impactful essay will come from describing the activity that means the most to you personally. To decide on an activity, ruminate on the following questions: 1) Which of your activities have you given the most time to? Which one has been the most influential in your life? 2) What is the strongest emotion you feel about that activity? Why do you feel that way? Has that emotional response changed over time? 3) Have you developed or strengthened any personality traits due to your participation in this activity? If so, what are they and how have they evolved over time? 4) Have you developed any specific skills as a result of participating in this activity? 5) What influence does this activity have on the rest of your life? Once you have your activity in mind, you should consider your structural approach to the essay. With only 300 words, you most likely won’t be able to explain everything you ever did within a certain club or activity or job. Rather, pick out two or three instances that show your unique contribution to the activity and what you learned from the experience.",

Instead, consider what excites you about your intended field of study, as well as the specific dimensions of this subject that fit your strengths and ambitions. Instead of mentioning the general advantages of a Rice education, such as the high standard of academic performance and the accomplished faculty, you should discuss explicit offerings such as the Century Scholars Program, which assigns participants a faculty mentor for guidance in undergraduate research. If you’ve visited the campus, writing about the content of a lecture that you sat in on, or the reflections of current students in the same program can demonstrate your interest in the school.

Instead, dig beyond the first page of Rice’s website, to find details about the school that most other applicants do not have, and show Rice admissions officers that you already have a clear sense of how you would fit into their campus community. These could be details about student organizations, study abroad programs, research opportunities, or really anything that takes admissions officers outside of the classroom, to show them what your broader Rice experience would look like. Finally, keep an eye on the word count—150 words isn’t many to work with.

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a classic example of a Diversity prompt. Santa Clara University is using this prompt to get to know you and your background a little bit better, so this is a great opportunity to dig into some of your more unique experiences, or character traits that you feel are particularly important to who you are. A common misconception is that a Diversity essay has to focus on an identity characteristic, but in reality, your answer can be almost anything that you feel has contributed to who you are. It’s not just picking an attribute, identity, or aspect of yourself that makes for a good essay; it’s also making a case for what your chosen subject says about you, and what you’ll bring to Santa Clara. It’s also important to note that while the Supreme Court ended affirmative action this summer, colleges continue to consider racial diversity on an individual basis through information shared in essays. If your racial or ethnic heritage has helped shape who you are, what you believe, and what you value, this could be a good time to write about that. What should you choose if you don’t want to write about your racial ethnic background? Your options are broader than you might think. You might write about your religion, sexuality, gender identity, or socioeconomic status, but you could also write about hobbies, languages, or family structure. You could go a bit more abstract, and write about personality traits, talents, or values that set you apart from the crowd. Consider these examples of students who wrote unique diversity essays about uncommon traits they possess. One student wrote an essay about being the younger sister of identical twins, and how she navigated the expectations around how she and her twin sisters would relate to each other. Another student wrote about his strong value for honesty, how he stuck to it, even in tough situations, and how though people didn’t always understand it, his real friends came to respect his beliefs. An applicant wrote about collecting stamps from a young age, how it brought him into a world that was largely made up of older people, and what it was like to be in that space as a teenager. A student wrote about her stutter, and how self-consciousness over how she talked eventually grew into confidence, resilience, and inner strength. All of these examples, while perhaps not anyone’s first thought when they hear the word diversity, give deep insight into these students’ lives and their individuality. You’ll want to do the same, by highlighting what makes you stand out from the crowd. If you have an identity or experience that most other people don’t, consider writing about that, rather than something that might be more stereotypically associated with diversity. You want your essay to paint a vivid picture of you, one that can’t be confused with any other applicant the Santa Clara admissions team might be reading about. Once you’ve picked your topic, think about using anecdotes to illustrate your point, and show, don’t tell, the important details.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is an example of the Political/Global Issues archetype prompt, which means admissions officers want to see that you’re an engaged citizen who cares about the people around you and actively works to make your community better. Note that the prompt does not ask you to provide a full solution to the issue you choose to write about. Rather, your goal should be to explain how Santa Clara specifically, and its educational offerings, would help you start to address this challenge. The first step is to identify the ethical dilemma you want to focus on. Make sure to choose an issue that you genuinely, personally care about. As the question says, don’t discount the power of local-level problems–having a direct connection to the issue is always a plus, and other students are less likely to be writing about them. Regardless of the scale of the issue, you should emphasize the ethical or moral dimension of it, as the prompt specifically requests that. For example, if you want to write about manatees being killed by irresponsible boaters near your hometown in Florida, make sure you explicitly state your belief that all animals, including non-human ones, have a right to a safe habitat. The next step is to demonstrate how specific resources at Santa Clara, or the school’s broader values, will help you deal with this issue. Here, you should show that you have done your research on what SCU offers, and have spent time thinking about how those offerings align with your own goals. The majority of your essay should focus on this connection to Santa Clara, which is really the heart of the prompt–you shouldn’t spend more than a couple of sentences describing the issue itself. To brainstorm what ethical dilemma you’ll write about, consider the following questions: What ethical dilemmas do you feel most strongly about? Think about issues that affect you or your community directly, as well as global-scale ones. Why do you care about this issue? What personal experiences have shaped your perspective on it? How have you engaged with this issue so far? Have you done related volunteer work, connected with others who care about it, or pursued relevant academic work? What specific programs, values, or resources at SCU will help you address this dilemma? Look into faculty with similar research interests, student organizations, community outreach opportunities, research or study abroad opportunities, or even SCU’s Jesuit values. How do you envision using your SCU education to make tangible strides towards resolving this issue in the future?",

Since your space is so limited, though, you’ll need to have a crystal-clear sense of what you want to say. To ensure your brief statement about your interest in your intended major is informative and compelling, think about what sparked your interest in this major, and how it aligns with your broader ambitions or goals. Additionally, have you taken any courses, participated in any extracurriculars, or pursued any hobbies that helped you refine your interest? Ideally, you’ll also want to touch on why you want to study this field at Santa Clara in particular. Supplements are all about showing your fit for this particular institution, so don’t just say why you want to study English. Every school has an English department, so what you want to focus on instead is what about studying English at Santa Clara in particular will allow you to reach your goals.

The good news is that there’s no right or wrong answer; you should allow your values and beliefs to shine through here. Both revolution and evolution involve change–revolution is radical, sudden, and dramatic, whereas evolution is gradual, slow, and incremental.\n\nBefore you get to writing, it might be helpful to think about your societal values. Consider things you might want to see changed, like healthcare, minimum wage, fast fashion, factory farming, or policing. Do you tend to want to see these things change profoundly and immediately, or do you think a slower, incremental change would work better? There are valid arguments for each route, but these arguments tend to be deeply personal.\n\nMaybe you think that there are huge problems that can only be solved with a massive societal shift overnight, or maybe you think that progress can only be sustained if it’s gradual and planned out. Either way, you should think of concrete examples like the aforementioned ones to illustrate your position. With a prompt like this, conviction is key. You don’t necessarily need to feel intensely tied to one option over the other, but you do have to pick and argue for one in this essay.\n\nThere are a couple of things to note:\n\n- You should define both evolution and revolution briefly at the beginning of your response to give it some direction. Many students decide to cite a dictionary and quote its definition, but this has frankly become a big cliché. You should define the words in your own words and avoid the “according to Merriam-Webster” trope. Of course, you can consult dictionaries to refine your definitions, but this is a relatively short essay, so using your own words throughout is strongly recommended.\n- You need some concrete examples to support your choice. While we usually recommend avoiding controversial political topics, this prompt is asking about revolution, and Soka is a liberal school. In light of this, it’s fine to discuss political topics, and it would be nearly impossible to write this essay well without mentioning specific issues. Since the word count is longer, you may be able to write about 2-4 concrete examples.\n- You may find it helpful to create a hypothetical progress scenario just to point out how either revolution or evolution would work well and how the other wouldn’t.\n\nLet’s look at the second half of the prompt. How do you see dialogue being a catalyst for progress and change? Maybe you think dialogue on its smallest scale will allow us all to find common ground on the right way to move forward. Or maybe you feel that dialogue is most important at the highest levels of government so that all countries can align in their decisions.\n\nFor example, when it comes to fast fashion, dialogue between educators and consumers can help individuals overcome throwaway culture and learn to care for their clothing. Dialogue is also necessary among elected officials, workers, and businesses in passing bills to protect garment workers’ rights.\n\nOr, maybe your example is universal basic income and women’s unpaid labor. Dialogue could help the public understand the reasoning behind UBI, such as a media campaign where stay-at-home parents share their experiences and the amount of work they do each day.\n\nEither way, be sure to be specific and detailed about your ideas regarding dialogue catalyzing progress. You may even wish to cite examples from history of how smaller-scale or top-level dialogue brought about tangible progress.\n\nYou might not think dialogue has any role in being a catalyst for progress, but we recommend that you avoid writing that in your response. The question already presupposes that dialogue does act as a catalyst for progress, and Soka, like other universities, seeks to foster dialogue, discourse, and collaboration.\n\nWhile this question is more philosophical and academic, you can still consider different structures and formatting. A narrative structure works great if you have a strong anecdote that you can tie into both questions. A small collection of anecdotes might be useful if you have a relevant anecdote for each half of the prompt. If you don’t have relevant anecdotes or simply don’t want to use any, making straightforward declarative statements and answering each question in turn is absolutely fine too.",

        "prompt_text": "In today’s world, what is your purpose in seeking a liberal arts education? How would you use your SUA education as a tool to shape your future, living a contributive life? (500-750 words)",
        "word_limit": "500-750",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "There are two parts to this prompt. You are first asked to discuss why you are seeking a liberal arts education in today’s world. After that, you are asked how you would use your education from Soka to contribute to the world.\n\nSoka only has one undergraduate degree program, BA in liberal arts, in which you choose a concentration (Environmental Studies, Humanities, International Studies, Life Sciences, or Social and Behavioral Sciences). No one expects you to have an exhaustive, definite life plan at this stage, but it would be helpful if you had some general idea of what you want to study. Soka’s unique focus presupposes that you are at least leaning towards pursuing liberal arts. Thinking about what interests, fascinates, and motivates you will give you some insight into why you want to study liberal arts.\n\nOnce you have chosen those motivations, think about how a broad liberal arts education can help you achieve your goals. Maybe you want to be an author and consider a liberal arts education key to having a well-rounded style or a wider base of domain-specific knowledge.\n\nIf you’re interested in or passionate about liberal arts, you should be able to delineate your reasons for studying such subjects. The more open-ended question is the second one in the prompt. It subtly asks two things:\n- Why do you want a Soka education specifically?\n- How would you use your Soka education to contribute to the world?\n\nAnswering why you want to study at Soka specifically is a smaller-scale version of the “Why This College?” prompt. Check out CollegeVine’s guide to writing the “Why This College?” essay for some tips. Remember, you need to answer this entire prompt in 500-750 words, so be very succinct in this part of your response. Soka’s unique BA program is a good place to start, but you should also explore Soka’s student organizations and try to find one that resonates with you and your goals. Be specific in your response; a generic response doesn’t indicate a genuine interest in the university.\n\nAs for the other half of this question, you should think about how the specific education you receive can be worked into your career goals or life passions. Maybe you want to be a doctor, and a liberal arts background will help you be a more versatile practitioner in terms of how you interact with your patients and how you think analytically. Or maybe you want to work in agriculture and the environmental studies concentration, and the Soka Instructional Garden will prepare you to more thoroughly understand food sustainability programs.\n\nHere are examples of what not to do and what to do:\n- Weak: SUA is a renowned liberal arts college that appeals to me because I want to take an interdisciplinary approach to my education. I wish to join extracurriculars such as research opportunities and clubs like the student government. I believe I will thrive in the learning environment provided by the small class sizes.\n- Strong: I am intrigued by Soka’s concentration in Environmental Studies, especially the hands-on component. Being able to practice organic agriculture in the Soka Instructional Garden facilities would help me better understand sustainable food production. I grew up helping cultivate vegetables on my family’s farm, and I spent weekends selling produce at the farmer’s market. These experiences bred my passion for agriculture and business. At the same time, I consider myself an environmentalist and strive to support sustainable practices. I would like to one day start an environmentally-conscious food production business; Soka’s hands-on agricultural experiences would equip me with a strong foundation of knowledge and skills to achieve my goals.\nFurthermore, having a background in liberal arts will allow me to approach my business with a more nuanced perspective. Business is not only technical and transactional; it also requires a strong grasp of what drives people and society. At SUA, I will not only be able to gain real experience in my direct field of interest (environment and agriculture), but I will also develop a strong foundation in relevant fields such as psychology. A liberal arts degree will equip me with the skills to develop multidimensional business solutions in the context of the communities they impact.\n\nThe former response doesn’t demonstrate a deeper knowledge of Soka; it only really talks about resources that can be found at nearly every college. The latter response shows a genuine interest in Soka by naming unique opportunities and how they align with the student’s individual goals. Additionally, the student addresses why a liberal arts college in general is a strong choice personally.",

Since SMU is a selective school, it’s important to write strong, specific responses to help your application stand out. Even though these prompts are technically optional, we strongly encourage you to respond to both of them. When you’re competing with thousands of other applicants, you want to make sure you give admissions officers as much information about yourself as you can.

        "word_limit": "250 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Like many other institutions, SMU has the “Why This College?” prompt. The reason schools use this prompt is because they want to discern which applicants are truly passionate about attending their school. One thing that distinguishes a mediocre essay from an exceptional essay is specificity. The more specific your response is, the more compelling it will be. With specificity in mind, you should do some research on SMU before you begin writing. Look into SMU’s academics (specifically programs of study and research centers), student organizations, core values, and faculty. Doing research allows you to get a good idea of what the college is like and what may resonate with you most when you arrive on campus. Finding things that really pique your interest will give you the specificity that your response requires. You ideally want to show at least a tangible connection to the university. A tangible connection means that you have specific reasons for wanting to attend the university that are unique to that university alone. These can include: The campus culture, Classes or academic opportunities, Professors or research groups, Traditions, Other on-campus opportunities or programs. Be specific. Generic statements like “I heard the business program is strong” and “the location is nice” are too broad and could apply to hundreds of universities all over the U.S. Instead of making a generic statement like “The business school is strong,” write something specific to SMU that led you to apply there. For example, you could write: Two years ago, my brother began coding algorithms to model and predict industry trends and market shares. He created a small start-up for this service that is already being used by seven client companies! The problem is that his expertise is entirely in computer science, not business. I love business, and for the last two years I’ve dreamed of helping run this budding start-up while attending college. Seeing the potential for growth we possess has inspired me to educate myself in the business world. In this type of essay, it’s important to weave in details about yourself that highlight your unique qualities and ultimate viability as a candidate. In the above example, mentioning the company research workshops offered by the Kitt Investing and Trading Center shows that you have researched and taken interest in a particular aspect of the university, and mentioning the company you’re going to work for shows that you have knowledge about the business world. You should also express an intangible connection with the university if possible. The intangible connection to the university is a question of whether your values align with those of the university. For example, does the university or a specific program care about interdisciplinarity, helping underserved communities, environmental justice, religious faith, or intellectual creativity? If you find something that resonates with you, be sure to mention that in your response! Regardless of the school you apply to, you need to add information specific to that school, and in this example, talking about a certain program indicates that you are thoroughly interested in a tangible part of the university as well as an intangible value you share with the university. An example like this demonstrates genuine interest and shows why you would be a good fit for the school, while also showing your enthusiasm to attend. The prompt explicitly says to describe “specific” factors that led you to apply to SMU, so follow the directions! Is it family ties? The opportunity to move from your busy city life on the East Coast to a smaller setting in Texas? The more specific you are, the better. Bear in mind that you only have 250 words to work with, so be succinct and direct in your response.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is a very standard diversity prompt. The idea behind this question is that the school has a diverse campus with students coming from all over the U.S., and all over the world for that matter. They want to see the different perspectives that their applicants are bringing to the table; admissions officers want to know where you’re from, what the community you grew up in is like, and what matters to you. You should ask yourself a few questions before writing to guide the direction of your essay: What is a community that you belong to or a background that you have that has impacted your development and worldview? This can include your ethnic/racial background, gender identity, sexual orientation, country of origin, language, hometown or neighborhood, income class, illness or disability, or even interests and extracurricular activities. What is the strongest emotion you feel about your background? Have you discovered or honed a skill or talent because of the part of your background you have chosen to write about? Have you developed or strengthened any personality traits as a result of this background? If so, what are they and how have they changed over time? Think about any formative experiences you had as a result of your background. Is there a mistake you’ve made before as a result of your background that you know not to repeat? Do you view an institution differently from other people because of some aspect of your identity? For each experience, you should be able to describe what happened, how you felt and what you thought at the time, how your feelings have changed about it since then, and if you’ve faced any subsequent challenges because of it. A strong diversity essay will incorporate information from the questions above with a focus on the emotions you feel about your identity and any skills/talents you’ve developed because of your background. Given the small word limit, you may wish to zoom in on how you feel about your background and how this background will add to the university’s diverse community. You should avoid listing every community you’re a part of or every quality that makes you unique. You want to focus on elucidating one quality rather than just making a list of qualities and describing none of them. You should also try not to talk about an overly-common experience like immigration or a fully negative experience. Of course, not every story has a happy ending, but it’s difficult to execute this kind of essay well when writing only about negative experiences. Overall, this prompt is not meant to fool or trick you — it’s just meant to serve as an extended introduction to who you are. Ask yourself: “What can I contribute to campus, and what will the campus offer me specifically?” Remember that you are asked both how your background will contribute to the University and how you will benefit from the University community. Be sure to be concise but also comprehensive in your response.",

Since Stanford admissions are so extremely selective, it places a good deal of pressure on both the content and execution of all 11 essays. While Stanford has a reputation of being pretty relaxed and laid back, you shouldn’t try to exude that attitude throughout all your essays. Remember that it is the admissions office’s job to read through over 40,000 of these essays each year and discern whether you would be a good fit, so avoid topics that are even vaguely cliché and be brutally honest with yourself about whether you would enjoy the essay you’ve written from an outsider’s perspective.

Just writing about this idea or realization should make you feel like an extremely happy nerd (you are applying to Nerd Nation after all!). Whether you are someone who approaches standardized testing like it is a thrilling game, or someone who feels so excited after getting through a test that you poured countless hours into studying for, you can really highlight your own drive and intellect through this prompt. For example, you could write some sort of introduction about deciding to self-study for the AP Physics C tests, then add some analysis like: …I began to honestly enjoy learning all the new applications for the calculus concepts I had been learning alongside physics, previously unaware of just how intertwined they were. The relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration through derivatives and integrals tied everything together in a way that made so much sense it gave me chills. After a few study sessions, I began to devour YouTube videos to prepare for the test, and each time I understood a new concept by learning it on my own, I felt more accomplished and intellectually independent. As I worked through practice problems and self-corrected my way across old exams, I felt driven to stop excusing or dismissing my mistakes, and to instead pull them apart by analyzing exactly why I had made them to target and avoid them in the future. This experience improved the way I study and showed me the value of truly mastering knowledge on my own. This response shows an authentic passion for learning without overloading on narrative. As you approach your own essay, avoid using basic statements like “This made me excited because…” or “An idea that made me genuinely excited about learning was…” since your writing style is extremely important throughout this essay. Compare the two examples above syntactically to see why the essay becomes more engaging with the style of “show not tell” displayed in the latter.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "The point of this essay is to invoke the casual nature of roommate relationships and invite students to take a more relaxed approach to writing about themselves. It brings the application to life by asking you to write only about your own personality, which feels more open than other essays that ask you to answer a specific question like “Describe your community” or “Talk about a mentor who got you through a difficult time.” While answering both of those prompts still offers insight into who the author is, they are fundamentally centralized around another person or topic, which is why Stanford cuts straight to the chase with this prompt to actually get to know you better. Stanford is looking for an extremely authentic 250-word portrayal of your character that could distinctly identify you from a crowd of essays. If you got to meet your admissions officer in person, and only had 60 seconds to pitch yourself without using anything from your activities or awards, what would you say first? If you were legitimately writing a letter to your roommate at Stanford, what would you want them to know about the prospect of living with you? If you imagine how your Stanford alumni interview might play out, what topics do you hope to steer towards? Think deeply about these questions and first see if there is something meaningful that you want to convey, and look through Prompt 3 to see if it would best serve answering the question, “What matters to you, and why?” instead of this roommate prompt. If you do have a more serious answer, you can style the essay like a very formal letter or like a traditional 1-2 paragraph short essay without any of the letter gimmicks at all to stand out syntactically. If you don’t think you have any important topics on the serious side that you want to specifically cover in the space for this prompt (an extreme medical condition, a family hardship etc.), you could also go for another popular tactic by creating a fun, miscellaneous essay. This prompt can arguably be one of the most entertaining to write and read of all college supplemental essays because of the opportunity to present the admissions office with an amalgamation of weird topics. A previous CollegeVine guide encouraged students to explore their quirky side with this prompt by writing about unique hobbies or interesting personality oddities. It also advises staying away from things like politics (i.e., don’t indicate which party or ideology you tend to support, even through jokes or minor references, since you don’t want to step on any toes). Don’t sweat too much over the exact way to put the essay in letter format. Starting with something like “Hi! I am ridiculously stoked to meet you!” or any other straightforward greeting that doesn’t sound too cheesy is totally fine. If you decide to, you can essentially make a bullet list of “fun me facts” if you want to include the maximum amount of content. Remember that this essay should be fun!",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a classic example of the Diversity Essay. Your response should focus on your personal background and how your life experiences or cultural traditions provide you with a unique perspective that has influenced your interests and character. Stanford is looking for what makes you unique and how you will share that uniqueness with their community. Your response should directly answer the question at hand; however, remember to “show, not tell.” A personal narrative is one way to successfully highlight your potential individual contributions to Stanford’s community. For example, instead of simply saying that you are hardworking and persist despite obstacles, describe a time where you displayed this skill. Perhaps you grew up in the central US where there are seasonal tornadoes and damage to property. You could share a story about how you help rebuild neighbors homes every year after the storms and how you have learned about the value in lending a helping hand to strangers. Or, if you want to discuss your deep connection and commitment to your culture, describe a particular event or custom that has meaning to you that most other applicants would not be aware of. Or maybe you have a strong commitment to sustainability—you could discuss a time you created an initiative to reduce food and plastic waste in your school cafeteria. Beware that this question is similar to some Common Application prompts. Since the Stanford application is on the Common App, you should use this supplement as a means to communicate something new about yourself to the admissions committee, so avoid discussing topics that you’ve already covered. For example, if your Common Application focused on your analytical mind, consider using this prompt to discuss your compassion for others. In the remaining space you have in the essay, tie your unique identity back to how you will contribute to Stanford’s campus. If you have a deep connection to your Native American culture, mention how you are excited to be involved with the American Indian Organization at Stanford. All in all make sure that the life experience, interest and/or character trait you are sharing in this essay is unique to you and provide evidence to support the unique self that you will bring to campus.",

There’s no way to answer all of these questions in such limited space without just making a list, so you’ll want to pick just one of the options listed, and use the 'Why This College?' portion of the prompt as your guide. The question opens with what compels you about Syracuse and closes with what you’ll bring to the campus community, so establishing that connection to the school is a crucial aspect to include to make your essay as effective as possible. Start by doing some serious research into Syracuse and finding something that interests you or resonates with you. This question is intended to identify and weed out applicants who aren’t serious about attending, so you shouldn’t stop at the website homepage and say that you’re excited about 'research.' Dig deeper into student organizations, classes, and undergraduate research opportunities, and other activities that you can use as a launchpad to demonstrate your own character. The more specific your 'why' is, the clearer it will be that you’re passionate about Syracuse and that you care about its programs. Not only that, but it will give you a clear beginning for the personal anecdote piece of this prompt, which should connect directly to whatever it is that compels you about Syracuse. We cannot emphasize specificity enough. Anyone can say that they love Syracuse’s commitment to diversity, so the key is to go deeper—maybe you ran the LGBTQ+ organization at your high school and you want to continue to contribute to a more accepting world by joining Syracuse’s Safe Zone team. The admissions committee at Syracuse will already be familiar with the University’s programs, clubs, and academics, so don’t spend too much time explaining exactly what you’re interested in. Instead, describe why you’re a good fit for that major or initiative. Choose an anecdote that demonstrates the qualities you’re trying to showcase, ideally one that clearly ties in with your reasons for wanting to attend Syracuse. Finally, try to end with how you’re going to bring these qualities into the Syracuse community. In the end, this essay isn’t just about how great of an applicant you are, it’s about helping the admissions committee envision you thriving on Syracuse’s campus, and making the community stronger as you do.",

An essay can easily be thoughtful, insightful, and an engaging read without utilizing this specific emotional appeal. Still, stories about difficult circumstances are often memorable. They are most effective when focused primarily on the student’s journey of working through the challenge instead of the challenge itself. You’re trying to stand out, so beware of overused tropes like the following: Mental illness, getting a bad grade in a class, sports stories, death of a pet or family member, divorce, mission trip which made you realize how lucky and privileged you are. Side note: Sometimes students face challenges that are outside of their control and which have negatively impacted their academic and/or extracurricular performance. If this has been your experience, and you don’t want to explain them within this essay response, you may ask one of your recommenders to do so through their letter of recommendation, or explain it in the shorter prompt #4. Overall, the admissions officers are looking for growth. They want to see the circumstances you turned into opportunities for improvement.

Before you begin writing, you should think about the different paths you can take when answering this question: Is there a unique event that has made a substantial impact on how you study, take exams, learn in general, or see a certain aspect of the world? Besides any unique events, what other occurrences have prepared you for any aspect of college life? The aspects can be academic, interpersonal, career-oriented, social, etc. One effective way to address this prompt is to think of what you want to major in.

An example might be a natural disaster or family emergency.\n- You did not have sufficient time or access to resources to complete work inside or outside of school. An example might be helping family with childcare or a lack of regular Internet access that prevented you from completing homework.\n- Though you were present and had access to resources, you were unable to fully engage with school. An example might be an undiagnosed learning disorder, or a personal tragedy that made it difficult to focus.\n\nIf your experience falls into any of these broad categories, or is closely related, you might consider writing this supplement, so the admissions committee can be aware of this circumstance as they evaluate your application. If you experienced something difficult in high school but it did not affect your academic performance, do not answer this prompt.\n\nIf you do choose to write this essay, keep your writing clear and concise. Write specifically and plainly about what your circumstances were and how they affected your ability to attend school, focus in school, or complete work outside of school. This is not an essay where you need to worry about unique narrative structure, vivid description, or sophisticated language choice; just be clear about what your situation is or was.\n\nFinally, make sure to clearly state exactly how this circumstance affected your academic performance. If you write that you suffered from Lyme disease, explain how those symptoms made it difficult for you to focus or attend school; do not expect admissions officers to know how that condition might impact a person’s life.

If you do feel COVID or a natural disaster has impacted your academic record, there are many ways it might have done so. Here are some things to consider.\n\n- Maybe contracting COVID once or repeatedly, or fleeing or recovering from a natural disaster, meant that you missed critical times in school that you were unable to make up or catch up on.\n- Perhaps you had to switch suddenly to online schooling, or take extra precautions for yourself or an immunocompromised family member, and the stress of these changes took a toll on your focus and classroom performance.\n- You may have developed long COVID, or a medical condition or disability in relation to a natural disaster, like smoke from fires aggravating your asthma.\n- Many families’ finances and access to resources were severely affected by COVID or by other natural disasters. If your financial situation or access to resources changed suddenly, your ability to perform academically or remain involved in activities may have been affected.\n- Maybe you lost someone or some important things, like a home or material possessions, as a result of COVID or a natural disaster. The grief associated with this may have affected your academic record or activities.\n\nIf you do choose to write a response to this essay, keep your answer clear, detailed, and specific. There is no word limit, but try to keep to the facts of what happened and how it affected you. This is not a prompt where you should think about uniqueness or dynamic story structure; focus on explaining your circumstances concisely and clearly, with attention to how the experience affected you.\n\nYou don’t need to explore global effects, or describe a catastrophe in detail. Keep it personal, and keep it precise, describing how this event looked in your own life. You can be a bit broader here in terms of impact—this prompt allows you to talk about impacts not just in school, but on your family, safety, circumstances, and future plans. Statements should still be specific—“Having long COVID made me doubt that I could handle leaving home to go to college, which made me less motivated to get back to school” is a stronger statement than “Having long COVID changed everything.”\n\nIf you do have unusual circumstances that have affected your life and your college application, the University of Tennessee wants to consider that as they review your application.

Leaders are individuals with strong values, who mentor, inspire, correct, and assist those around them. If you don’t feel like you’ve ever been a leader, consider the following questions: Have you ever mentored anyone? Is there anyone younger than you who would not be the person they are today without you? Have you ever taken the initiative? When and why did it matter? Have you ever been fundamental to positive change in the world—whether it be on the small scale of positively impacting a family member’s life or on the large scale of trying to change the status of specific communities/identities in this world?

Leadership is a concept that can be stretched, bent, and played with, but at the end of the day, the central theme of your essay must be leadership.

The ultimate goal here is to outline your past academic background, your future academic/career goals, and your intellectual passions—all in an engaging essay that stands out! A good first step is to think about your major and how you became interested in your major: Was there a specific event that triggered your interest? For example, a student who picked up a book by Audre Lorde at the library, was unable to put it down, then learned about their interest in LGBTQIA+ communities, so they decided to major in Women and Gender Studies. Was there a specific moment when you realized your future career goals? For example, a student who went to work with their mother one day because school got canceled and saw the intensity of an emergency hospital, then realized that they don’t want to work in emergency care, but they do want to be a doctor. Do the values associated with your field align with your values? For example, a student choosing to study Architectural Engineering because they value reason and things making sense or a student choosing to get a certificate in Latin American and Latinx Studies because they are passionate about minority representation in media. This “How I Got Interested” story could serve as a unique way to frame your essay. An anecdote could help your essay stand out amongst all the activities, experiences, and goals that admissions officers will be reading about. That being said, you should supplement your anecdote with the details from the prompt: prior/current coursework, extracurricular activities, and work/volunteer experience. Keep in mind that your courses, activities, and experiences don’t have to exactly align with your major or intellectual interests. This can be a place for you to show your understanding of the connectedness of academics and forefront ideas of interdisciplinarity. Of course, you can write about something expected like high school theatre inspiring you to study Theatre at CU Boulder. But, if you need to stretch, that’s okay also! Here are some examples of stretching your coursework and extracurriculars: A student planning to study Strategic Communication could reference their AP Psychology course and emphasize the value of understanding the human mind to applying effective communications strategies. A student planning to study Theatre might mention their performances as a witness for their high school’s mock trial team. A student planning to study Philosophy could write about their involvement with a science fiction book club on campus and describe the fundamental philosophical concepts that permeate today’s literature. A student planning to study Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology could mention their past experiences with computer science and recognize the ways that technology and medicine are increasingly interacting. Finally, if you write about career goals, make sure that your field of study aligns with your future career. If it is tangentially related (like studying English to go into Communications or studying Political Science to go into Journalism), focus on the skills that you will learn in your major curriculum that will help you in your future career. Stretch less here. If your major doesn’t relate to your career goals, focus on your passion for your major and your past experiences with your major.",

Before participating in the Take Stock in Children program, I wasn’t interested in attending college, and I was planning to work at my local grocery store after high school to support my hobby, music production. James helped me understand the importance of college and he encouraged me to pursue a Bachelor of Music degree at the University of Florida. I am grateful for how my involvement with Take Stock in Children has impacted my future education and aspirations.”",

For example, a weak response would merely say that you are interested in UIC’s B.S. in Computer Science because you grew up playing retro computer games. But a strong response would draw a specific connection between noticing glitches in the gameplay of those retro games, constantly wondering how the game programmers’ logic inadvertently created those glitches, and wanting to pursue a career in software quality assurance. As you write your essay, keep in mind the importance of drawing the linkage between experience and interest. We recommend beginning this essay with the anecdote that you will use to demonstrate how your interest in your major developed. This anecdote might be a personal, non-academic experience, or it may be related to coursework. Of course, a strong essay likely combines these two types of experiences: perhaps your interest in computer science logic was strengthened by writing your own proofs for the first time in a geometry class.",

Since this essay is for the Honors College, you’ll also want to make sure that your essay adequately discusses your academic history and success. Before you begin writing, you’ll want to spend some time thinking about moments throughout your life that have impacted your personal and academic growth. This might be the hardest part of this essay, as finding a topic that is both meaningful and significant can be tricky. Below are some mistakes you’ll want to avoid when picking an essay topic. Picking a Topic That Is Cliché: There are many essay topics that have become cliché in the college process because admissions officers have seen them so many times before. They include sports injuries, personal tragedies, or getting a bad grade. Picking a Topic that Isn’t Significant Enough: Topics that aren’t meaningful enough may include group project failures or interpersonal conflict unrelated to your academic history. While these experiences are certainly important in your life, you should try to pick an experience that shaped your identity. Remember, you’ll want to pick an example that highlights both academic and personal growth–not just one or the other. Picking an Extremely Personal Topic: Topics such as pet deaths and breakups should be avoided as they are too personal and do not highlight any types of academic engagement which should be included in this essay. Now that you’ve had a chance to think about potential topics, it is important to understand how to actually write the essay. You can do this in three steps: 1. Describe The Situation: Set the scene for the reader by discussing the academic or personal growth challenge that you’ve faced. You’ll want to be sure to add vivid details here so that the reader fully understands and can imagine the situation. 2. The Steps You Took to Overcome the Situation: What happened next in the story, and what role did you play in your own growth or challenges? 3. Reflect on What You Learned: Last, you’ll want to reflect on what this experience taught you, and how you changed because of it. This part of the essay is especially important as admissions officers want to know how students have positively changed through their previous life experiences.",

Not only do you need to identify the experiences that shaped your interest in your selected major, but you need to provide deeper reflections as to why those experiences impacted you in the way they did. For that reason, it’s not enough to simply list the experiences that led you to your chosen major. For example, you shouldn’t just say: “I first discovered my passion for film in English class, when I had to write a take home essay about the movie adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray. I furthered my interest in film by making my own home documentary alongside a couple friends. I also started volunteering at a local arthouse cinema to understand a more commercial perspective on film…” Rather, it’s better to go deeper with a given example and provide insights into what motivates your passions. Instead of simply listing experiences related to film, you might say: “My English teacher assigned our class a take-home essay, where we analyzed the movie adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Looking at the movie through a closer lens gave me a deeper appreciation for the small decisions directors make and the big impacts they can have…” The admissions readers at UIUC want to see that you have the necessary experiences under your belt to thrive in your chosen course of study, and they also want to see that you will be passionate and motivated while doing so! Make sure to show them both your experiences and your deeper insights about those experiences, and you’ll have a strong essay on your hands.",

        "word_limit": "150",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "The trick to this prompt is making sure you convey a clear personal or career goal, while also relating your intended course of study to that goal. Thus, you should acknowledge the following main points while answering this prompt: What are your future personal or career goals? How will your chosen major help contribute towards those goals? Let’s address each of these points separately. 1. What are your future personal and/or career goals? The prompt plainly states that your response needs to identify your future personal or career goals. If you have a clear idea of what your goals are, that will make this part easy. In that situation, you would have presumably chosen a course of study that will serve as a stepping stone towards your longer-term ambitions. On the other hand, UIUC knows that your interests will change over the next four years, and that nothing is set in stone. If you’re uncertain about your career goals, it’s also okay to identify a few possible career paths that interest you. Another option is to discuss the type of work you wish to do (e.g. helping deliver aid to marginalized communities) as opposed to the specific career title. Keep in mind that UIUC gives you the option of specifying your personal goals as well, and not just your career goals. Your personal goals should still be related to your major, but don’t have to be as career-focused. For instance, some solid personal goals to mention would be things like becoming a stronger public speaker, learning to program in a certain coding language, doing research on a specific topic, or writing a novel. As long as you can make a compelling case as to how your chosen major relates to your future ambitions, you will be in good shape for this essay. 2. How will your chosen major help contribute towards those goals? Once you have identified your personal or career goals, you also need to indicate what aspects of your chosen course of study will help you achieve those goals. This will mean both speaking about your major in broad terms, as well as identifying some features of UIUC’s course of study that serve you particularly well. This is not a “why UIUC” essay, so showing depth of research is not the top priority, but it will strengthen your response nonetheless. While this essay does not require personal reflections in the way that many other college essays do, it is still important for your voice to come through in deeper analyses that show you understand the significance of your major-goal combination at a deeper level. To accomplish this, make sure you are always stating why a particular aspect of your intended major serves your goals. For instance, it is not enough to say, “I hope to be a lawyer for the United Nations, so I want to take the course Governing Globalizations.” You might instead write: “Courses such as Governing Globalizations, which explore the historical, moral, socio-economic, and political dimensions of an emerging global society, will provide me with the interdisciplinary background to thrive as an international lawyer.” This second version goes the extra mile, by showing exactly what you hope to learn from this course and why that knowledge is relevant to your future ambitions, to truly give UIUC admissions officers the information they’re looking for.",

Some examples of challenges that may apply include: Major illness, Death in the family, Divorce, Job loss in the family, Anything else that prevented you from achieving at your potential. You don’t need to take up the full word count; only use the space you need. Here’s an example: “During my entire high school career, I had to babysit for my two younger siblings right after school because my family couldn’t afford daycare. As a result, I was unable to do sports or other extracurriculars, however, these many afternoons prepping snacks and coming up with new games to play were valuable in teaching me responsibility and creativity.” While you don’t want to go into a ton of descriptive detail like you would in a typical supplement, you should ideally touch briefly on what you learned from this experience, like this example does.

A great starting point to research the school for this response is the school’s website, which contains copious information about its values, unique offerings, and campus culture. Also, avoid listing school rankings or hackneyed adjectives praising the school, as this can come across as disingenuous. Admissions officers already know their school’s strengths and statistics—they want to learn more about you specifically, and how you plan to take advantage of UMass Amherst’s offerings. Because one of the other supplemental prompts focuses on why you chose your major, you should avoid any overlap in this essay—that is to say, try not to write about your desired major here.

This prompt is very straightforward, but it also gives you a lot of freedom to talk about any community that is meaningful to you and what you do as a part of it. The goal of this essay is to demonstrate that you are an active community member and can fit right in at UMass Amherst. It’s crucial that you pick a community that is central to your life and one that you play a significant role in. Including the examples given in the prompt, here are a few examples of communities you could consider: Religious community, Racial or ethnic community, Sports teams, Clubs and extracurricular organizations, Volunteer organizations, Political movements, Apartment building or street block, Online communities or groups, Community of people who share a similar hobby or interest. As you can see, there are many different ways to approach this essay. You might even write about a language community, or a community of people with a similar disability. Once you know what community you want to write about, you need to discuss your role within the community. For tips on choosing a community and writing thoughtfully about it, check out our guide to writing the diversity essay. A quick note: Earlier this year, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling, however, still allows colleges to consider race on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts as one of their supplemental essay prompts. If you feel that your racial background has impacted you significantly, this is the place to discuss that. When choosing a community, don’t make the mistake of thinking you can only talk about one where you were a leader or contributed to some big project—even as a member of the community you could still play a large role. When you’re thinking about the role you played, ask yourself these four questions: What actions do I generally take? Why do I enjoy being in this community? How do I impact others in my community? What do I learn from being a part of this community? If you can answer these questions, you can definitely write an essay that is personal and informative. Including self-reflection, especially for the third and fourth question, will demonstrate your critical thinking and maturity to the admissions committee. It might help you to describe a formative experience that involved your membership in your chosen community. This experience should ideally be one in which you learned a new lesson, gained a new skill, or personally grew in some way. You are limited to 100 words total, including the last part of the prompt, which concerns your future involvement in the UMass Amherst community, so be sure to get right to the point. These questions might help you distill the entire experience into the most important points: What happened? What was going through your mind and how did you feel as it happened? How have your emotions about the event changed over time? Have you faced any challenges as a result of membership in this community or your background? Finally, the last part of this prompt asks how your membership in this community will help you enrich the UMass Amherst community. To discuss this, go beyond generic college tropes like late-night conversations with your roommate, as those are things you can find at any school. Instead, find some element of UMass Amherst that you’re specifically intrigued by. Maybe your Filipino community at home is extremely important to you, so you’re looking forward to joining the Filipino Student Association on campus to stay connected to that community. Or, perhaps you’re planning to start a fashion entrepreneurship club on campus to create a community that currently doesn’t exist. Even though you only have 100 words to work with, your response can still give your reader new information. Don’t write about something you’ve already discussed elsewhere in your application, limiting yourself by passing up one of the opportunities you do have to share something new with admissions officers. By the end of your essay, the admissions committee should know exactly what you value in a community and should be able to imagine you in specific communities at UMass Amherst. Ending the essay with your specific ideas for your community involvement at the school will leave the admissions officers with a positive impression of you as an involved student.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "A “Why this Major?” prompt is a way for colleges to learn more about you and distinguish you from other candidates with similar academic backgrounds and interests. Admissions officers want to learn more about your current experience with a subject you’re interested in, where your passion comes from, and how you plan to continue pursuing this passion beyond your college career. The committee can also get a better idea of your interest in UMass Amherst specifically, and an idea of how you plan to use its resources to better facilitate your learning. When brainstorming content for this prompt, think about what initially drew you to the subject. Avoid using general statements like “I want to be a civil engineer because I have always enjoyed working with my hands.” Dig deeper into your passion and give specific details—one applicant might talk about how a Lego set they received for Christmas during their childhood first sparked their love of building. Another might talk about how they always admired the architectural genius behind their favorite structure in their hometown. You should also tie your response to future goals you hope to accomplish with this major. A common mistake many students make here is being too general. Rather than using platitudes like “making the world a better place” and “helping others,” talk about specific things you could do to achieve these goals. Though you by no means need to have your career plans figured out, you can explore potential options to add depth to your response. For example, a prospective chemistry major might discuss wanting to invent a non-teratogenic pesticide. Someone applying as a math major might want to develop an online teaching program for students who struggle with the topic and implement it at underprivileged schools. Another factor to consider is how you plan to pursue this major at UMass Amherst, so that admissions officers will have a better idea of how you will fit into the campus culture. If you’ve already mentioned major-specific resources in the first essay, however, there’s no need to repeat yourself. You can instead focus on your interest in the major and your future goals. While you may have already discussed your academic goals in the first essay, consider this an opportunity to expand upon those goals in more detail. No matter how you approach this essay, you should research specific classes, research opportunities, programs, student organizations, and other opportunities for involvement that tie into your major. For example, a prospective psychology major might discuss how UMass’s specific psychology programs tie into their dedication to activism. A response could go something like this: “Participating in the Black Lives Matter movement has underscored my desire to explore the neural circuitry behind racism. As a psychology major, I plan to pursue this topic within UMass Amherst’s Psychology of Peace and Violence Program, by working with Professor Ervin Staub on developing active bystander training for police. I believe this biological approach to activism will go a long way in fomenting sustainable change at the systemic level.” Keep in mind that this is not a full response, but it does demonstrate the tone and level of detail you should aim for when writing a response to this prompt. Adding details like this will lend authenticity to your response and make it more fun to read. Admissions officers want to know why this major is important to you, so let your creativity and passion flow—the possibilities are endless!",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt is rather open-ended in that you can essentially discuss anything! Unique experiences, challenges overcome, and skills acquired are the three explicitly stated categories of things you might want to discuss. Given the introductory paragraph about diversity, you may want to consider writing about a unique life experience that highlights an aspect of your identity. Note that diversity encompasses several disparate aspects of identity, including ethnicity/race, country of origin, language, gender or sexual identity, geographical location, income class, disability or illness, personality trait, extracurricular interest, or something else entirely! An aspect of diversity might also be something that taught you or inspired your passions, something that you were born into, or something you’re just now learning that you’re a part of. The life experience you write about simply needs to represent a part of yourself that is genuine. A quick note if you intend to write about your racial background: In June 2023, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling, however, still allows colleges to consider race on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts as one of their supplemental essay prompts. If you feel that your racial background has impacted you significantly, this is the place to discuss that. Once you’ve chosen the life experience or aspect of your identity you want to write about, reflect on the impact that it’s had on your life and begin weaving that into your response. Think about the lessons you’ve learned along the way, the people you’ve met, and the skills you’ve learned. Whether you decide to write about an aspect of your identity, a life experience, a challenge you overcame, a skill you acquired, or something else entirely, be sure to describe how your topic served as an opportunity for learning and personal growth. Also don’t forget to address the final part of the prompt by stating how you will contribute to the UMiami community. This contribution can take a variety of forms, but it’s best to find a specific resource or opportunity at UMiami that you can see yourself being a part of.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is what’s called a 'Why This College' supplement: it is meant to gauge your interest in the school and how you would contribute to the academic and social environment of the university. This supplement contains two significant questions that you need to answer: 1. Why do you like the specific College you’ve chosen at UMich? 2. Why is this program a good fit for you on a personal and academic level? Basically, the admissions officers want to see whether you are genuinely passionate about attending the university (not reluctantly applying because your parents told you to, or because you see it as a safety school). They also want to know whether you have thought critically about how the college can support your academic and professional interests. Specificity is key, and you’ll need to do your research. Put the time and effort into studying what the university has to offer and what opportunities appeal to you. Why do you be a student here? Why is this college different to you from any other university? An effective way of checking that your essay is sufficiently specific to the school is the Name Plug-in Test. The steps to the Name Plug-In Test are as follows: 1. Replace the name of the school or department the essay is about with the name of a different school or department. 2. Read the essay over with the new name. 3. If the essay reads as an acceptable supplement for the new name school/department, it does not have enough detail. The goal of this question is for admissions officers to see how invested you are in attending the program you select, and if you would be a good fit for that program. You can show them your interest and passion for the program by doing proper research on your compatibility with it. Go on your College or School’s website and try to find answers to the following questions: Which professors would you be interested in working with? Why? Which courses appeal to you? What are programs within the department that interest you? Are there any initiatives, events, or workshops the department has that differ from other universities? What is the department atmosphere? Why would you want to be a part of that community? For example, if you’re interested in studying Education and are passionate about social justice, the UMich School of Education (SOE) might be a good fit for you because there’s a strong emphasis on diversity, inclusion, justice, and equity. During your time in the SOE, you might join the Student Rights Project, an interdisciplinary initiative by law, social work, and education students at UMich. The goal of the project is to keep students 'in school, learning, and out of the criminal justice system.' You’re particularly interested in helping provide special education support, as your sibling has a learning disability, and has faced an unsafe educational environment that led to unfair disciplinary action for their disability-related behavior. This would be a strong example, as the student not only cites a unique resource at UMich, but also connects that resource to their personal goals and background. You have to go beyond listing things you’re interested in, as anyone can do that. Take your essay the next step and mention why you’re interested in those aspects of UMich, and how they support your goals.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "The point of supplements in the college admissions process is for officers to gain a better, well-rounded understanding of who you are as an individual. Here, you are asked to reflect on a community that you are a part of, how it has changed you as an individual, and what role you fulfill in this community. This question gives you three separate parts to respond to: 'describe a community to which you belong' and 'describe your place within it.' It is important to always make sure that you are answering each part of the supplement! UMich is a university that prides itself in the openness and connection of its community, both between students on campus and between the university and the city of Ann Arbor. The school wants to read about how you contributed to and learned from a specific community, to better understand how you might interact with others at UMich. Although community is commonly thought of as a large cultural or societal group, you have flexibility in defining what your community is. As stated in the question, a community does not only have to be geographic, ethnic, racial, or societal: consider groups to which you belong that share something in common with you, regardless of size. It can consist of various individuals who all have a specific interest in common, like a sport, an academic passion, an extracurricular activity. It can also consist of a tight group of friends who all have bonded over a particular idea or club. Choose a group you belong to that has been most fundamental in shaping who you are, or that has been doing the most significant work. The university wants to hear your story of connecting to your community, and how you have both grown from it and contributed to it. For instance, maybe you’re a vegetarian, and you have a vegetarian recipes blog. You could discuss the connections you’ve made online (whether other bloggers or your audience), and how you’ve used your platform to discuss intersectional issues, like poverty and access to healthy/vegetarian food. Or, maybe you’re part of the Minecraft community, and have collaborated with people around the world to develop plugins for the game. Remember that you should primarily focus on your contributions to the community, rather than simply describing the community itself. The essay, after all, should focus on you and who you are.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This case discussion helps us learn more about your understanding of business. The topic should be unique to your interests, experiences, and knowledge. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' business situation to choose — it’s truly up to you. We encourage you to select a topic that you are passionate about, and not a global topic that you are disconnected from. With this prompt, Ross admissions officers want to better understand your grasp of business processes. Be sure to include technical terms and plenty of business jargon in order to demonstrate an understanding of the field. That being said, you don’t want your response to lack a narrative flair. First, identify the current event or issue in your community that you wish to write about. Don’t worry about the scale of the issue, but rather, make sure it is something you can write about extensively. The prompt emphasizes that it should be a pre-established passion, and not a vague global topic that you’re not connected to. Ideally, the topic will be something you have experience with and have already made an effort to research or resolve. For example, if you volunteer at an animal shelter, your essay could be about stray animals in your community. If you’re one of the only girls in your STEM classes, your issue could be targeting the gender gap in the field. You’ll want to start your essay with some sort of anecdotal line that provides enough context for readers to understand the issue at hand, and your connection to it. Then, you’ll want to spend the majority of your response constructing a business solution to the issue of your choosing. This, rather than the issue itself that you chose, is the most critical part of your response. When crafting a business plan, think about marketing tactics, consider relevant costs, and define what success looks like. You’ll want to research different business models and plans online to adequately grasp the best approach to your solution. However, don’t just copy one you like; use creative ways to splice different techniques and make a business solution that is uniquely yours. For example, maybe you want to implement a foster care initiative to combat the overcrowding at your local shelter. You would need to brainstorm an incentive, such as free vaccinations or neutering/spaying services for adopted animals. Then, you would estimate the relevant costs to the shelter and justify how the business decision makes financial sense for the shelter using the proper terminology. In your solution, the prompt emphasizes a focus on creativity and originality. The easiest way to communicate both of those things is by being specific and drawing on your personal experience. This will help you establish a unique perspective (your own!) and help admissions officers learn more about you and your approach to business – and the world.",

The options for artifacts are endless — there is no need to feel limited by this list. Note that your artifact does not need to be business related. Ask yourself: 'What are you most proud of from your four years in high school?' We also ask that you submit a short description that explains how your artifact demonstrates your learning in action. Essentially, what did you learn from this experience? Please limit this response to approximately 250 words. This prompt can be extremely overwhelming to read at first. There are probably a lot of accomplishments from your four years of high school that you are proud of, so it might be hard to narrow it down to just one. As you read over the list of examples, take note of whatever comes to mind and keep the result as a working list of options. From this list, determine which activities meant the most to you, and that you felt the most passionately about. Then, think about which of these activities would be the most unique in the eyes of admissions officers. What best showcases a unique aspect of your personality that has not been adequately explored in other parts of your application? What demonstrates your ability to think outside of the box and pursue your passions? Additionally, Ross only gives you 250 words to explain your artifact – so you’ll need to use this space wisely. Make sure you focus on the 'learning in action' component to really drive home the extent of your intellectual curiosity. For instance, if your artifact is a personal website, you could discuss learning a new coding language to create it. If your artifact is a set piece you built for the school musical, you could discuss how you acquired woodworking and painting skills. Again, the prompt gives you a lot of room and flexibility, so it can be tempting to focus on what you choose to write about. But equally as important is how you write about the artifact in question. Whatever you choose to discuss, make sure to use specific and technical language to demonstrate that you genuinely learned something new. This specificity will also be instrumental in illustrating your authenticity to the admissions committee. With this in mind, you’ll be on track to submit a stellar artifact and description.",

You basically have two questions to answer: first of all, which mission pillar is important to you? Then, you must reflect on how the program will help you build resilience, ingenuity, stewardship, and equity. We suggest first conducting research on the honors mission pillars. Admissions officers want to see your connection with the university and understand your personal values, so you’ll want to show that you know enough about the Honors College and how the honors mission pillars intersect with your strengths. After you’ve done research on the honors mission pillars and you’re able to define them, take some time to brainstorm how you may connect with these values. Below are some questions to help you brainstorm. Have you had any moments in your life where you’ve had to demonstrate the honors mission pillar values? What happened, and how did those values come into play? What personal values do you think are most important? Why? Which value do you think you exhibit the best or worst? What most impresses you about the Honors College? How is this connected to the honors mission pillar values? As you think of examples where you’ve used one of the honors mission pillar values, you’ll want to pick meaningful moments from your life rather than something that may be considered cliché. Below are topics that are often overused in college essays and that would be best to avoid: Sports injuries or challenges, Immigrant stories, A summary of your resume, Tragedies such as death or divorce, Volunteer trips or traveling, Someone you admire, Family pressure of going into a particular course of study, Moving to another area of the country. Some good examples you could use would be: An extracurricular activity that you were involved in and very passionate about, A moment that could be seen as insignificant but showed your true character, An important moment in your life that changed your perspective on something. After you’ve thought about your example, it is time to connect your story back with UNR and with what you’ve learned about the Honors College. One way to do this would be to make a list of what you believe the Honors College can bring you, and then try to fit those things in with the mission pillar value of your choice. An example of this approach would be a student who talked about the struggles they faced when running for student council, and how they learned to be resilient. They may discuss how they would like to bring their ideas to the Honors Student Council, and will bring the same resilient, determined personality to the Honors College. For this question, you’ll want to stay very organized and specific. A good response would include the following elements: A strong introduction where you pick the honors pillar value that you want to talk about and define what that value means to you. You’ll want to then discuss your connection to this pillar and tell a short story about how you connect to this pillar. Then, connect this back to the Honors College and take the essay one step further by projecting how the college could help you develop this value. You’ll want to be specific with how the Honors College can do this. Use specific examples/programs to make this connection. For this essay, stay organized! There are many moving parts to this prompt, so you’ll want to keep that in mind as you write. Lastly, remember to keep your response to 500 words. Since this is a longer prompt for only 500 words, keep your essay concise.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This prompt puts a spin on the traditional community service essay that asks about your involvement and impact on a community you are a part of. While you still need to address your impact on a community, you have to do it through the lens of a personal characteristic. In order to fully answer this question, you will need to pick a character trait and a community you are part of and then find a story that blends the two together. There are two main ways you could go about brainstorming. The first method is to start with a personal trait and work outwards to find an example that demonstrates that characteristic. This is a good approach if you have a character trait that contributes to your application theme. For example, if the theme of leadership is running throughout your application, you might want to write about your leadership and then find an example of a time when you exhibited it in one of your extracurricular or volunteer communities. The other approach is to pick a community that is important to you and work backwards to find a characteristic. This method will require more introspection as you will need to consider the role you play in the community, how you typically act, how you interact with other community members, etc. If you have a community that is a foundational part of your personality, this might be the approach for you. As you go about brainstorming, remember that there is no right or wrong character trait or type of community. In fact, you could even spin a 'negative' trait like being impulsive or anxious into a positive story—if you go down this road, be careful to show how you had a positive impact on the community and maybe how you fixed the negative trait through being part of the community. Once you’ve thought of a characteristic and a community you want to focus on, the next step is to come up with a story that highlights how your chosen personality trait led to a positive outcome in your chosen community. Ask yourself some guiding questions to remind yourself of important details that will make your story more engaging: Where were you? Who was involved? What types of conversations took place? Did you feel confident in your contribution or did you go outside of your comfort zone? What actions did you take? What were you hoping to accomplish? Now it’s time to start writing! Since you only have 250 words, you’ll want to get right to the heart of the story. A good tactic to accomplish this is to start in media res, or in the middle of the action. For example: 'A little more to the right. Up a little. No, dow—there! Perfect!' The large white tarp hung over the gym entrance, prepared to greet every student attending the rally, perfectly straight thanks to my razor-sharp eyesight and impeccable judgment. As you write, make sure you emphasize the story—after all, the prompt explicitly asks for a story or anecdote—by showing the reader through vivid imagery. Place the reader in the moment with active language ('running' instead of 'I ran'), use sensory descriptors ('the sweet smell of cinnamon and clove warmed the biting chill in the air'), and avoid generic adjectives like 'happy' or 'excited.' Another crucial thing to show (not tell) in this essay is your character trait. Readers like to feel like they are playing an active role in a story, meaning they want to pick up on clues and come to conclusions by themselves. If a student starts her essay by saying, 'My positive attitude inspired my lacrosse teammates to play our best even in terrible weather,' we immediately know exactly what her trait is, which leaves us less engaged. Instead, she can hint at her positivity without explicitly stating it by saying something like this: 'As fat raindrops started splattering on the windshield of the bus, a chorus of grumbles rose from my lacrosse teammates. 'Another rain game, really?' someone moaned. She had a point: our last three games had left us all wondering if we had accidentally tried out for the swim team. The drizzle quickly turned into a downpour, while Taylor Swift sang into my airpods 'It’s a cru-u-u-u-el su-u-mmer….' Wait, Taylor Swift? The artist famous for performing some of her best shows in the rain? Suddenly, I had an idea.' This is a much more immersive opening, which places us right alongside this student as she first commiserates with her teammates, and then thinks of a way to lift the mood. We get a lot more detail, which keeps us invested as we wait to see where the story is going, compared to the example above where we check out before the story even starts. It’s important that your reader be able identify what your character trait is and how it enabled you to positively impact your community. Looking at your essay, it should be easy to point to a change in the community for the better as a result of your involvement. Once you think you’re done writing, go back and ask yourself if that change is obvious. If not, keep revising until it’s clear.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "While you might be tempted to approach this prompt in the way you would approach a traditional 'Why This Major?' essay, hold on for a second and reread the prompt. Rather than being asked why you are pursuing a particular major or area of study, you’re being asked about 'an academic topic that you’re excited to explore and learn more about in college.' Yes, you will probably be most excited to study the topic of your major, but this prompt gives you the chance to look beyond your major and demonstrate the nuances of your interests. A good response will focus on a student’s major—'biology,' for example—but a great response will either hone in on a specific facet of the major or delve into interdisciplinary interests. For instance, a student who wants to hone in on a specific topic within biology might discuss her fascination with CRISPR genome editing and its ability to potentially cure leukemia. Although her major is technically just 'biology,' she is able to focus her essay on this niche topic within biology because this prompt doesn’t box you into discussing your major as merely a school curriculum. A different student might go down the interdisciplinary route by writing about his interest in gene expression and how environmental factors caused by housing and urban policy can influence what genes are turned on and off. While this essay would still be discussing concepts related to the student’s biology major, it would also demonstrate to the admissions committee the student’s multifaceted interests and his ability to connect seemingly unrelated topics. Whether you choose to drill down into a specific topic or to make connections between different topics, your essay should still be related to your major. If you’re deciding to major in biology but submit an essay to UNC about your love for American history without a single mention of science, it might raise some questions from the admissions committee. One of the best ways to show admissions officers your passion for a subject is through a story—in fact, when it comes to college essays, the best way to show anything is through a story! Anecdotes provide a natural and captivating introduction to your essay, can be used as supporting details for a point you are trying to prove, and can give the essay a common unifying theme. Whether you use your anecdote as a hook in the beginning or write the whole essay around it, it’s important to have a strong personal story when using an anecdote to demonstrate your interest in a topic. Some good sources of inspiration to get you started might include: Your first experience with the topic, An independent project you conducted on the subject, A time you struggled with the subject material, Key questions you have about the topic, A piece of media you consumed (podcast, book, TV show, etc.) that discussed or challenged your ideas on the topic, Your personal connection to the topic. The next important part of this essay is demonstrating your interest to show the admissions committee why you want to study this topic in further detail. Your anecdote will help accomplish this goal, but let’s break it down a little more. In order to successfully demonstrate your interest, you will need to show what, in particular, excites you about this topic. Is it a personal connection? Perhaps your goal is to cure a disease your family member suffers from. Alternatively, is it a chance for you to let your imagination and creativity run wild? If so, how does that feel? Will understanding this topic open doors for you to tackle even more complex issues? Whatever your point of interest in the topic is, you need to make it clear to the reader. A generic way of demonstrating your interest might look like this: 'I first learned about CRISPR technology in my freshman year biology class. The thought of modifying genes to fight diseases was so exciting to me. Ever since then, I’ve been interested in curing diseases like leukemia.' Those sentences tell us very little about the student’s interest, and they don’t really show us anything. Saying it was 'exciting' and that she was 'interested' isn’t descriptive enough to show the reader why the student is pursuing it. Compare that with this example: 'A blue and red helix swirled around the screen as nucleobases were cut and spliced. Within minutes the sequence was inserted and the DNA began replicating without a second thought to its new appendage. My eyes shot open and my jaw grew slack. Images of pristine, white hospital walls clouded my vision. The strong smell of disinfectant permeated the air. All those hours sitting with my mom, holding her cold hands through the chemo, and it could have been solved in minutes with CRISPR?' This version shows the reader infinitely more about the wonder and disbelief surrounding the topic with imagery like 'my eyes shot open and my jaw grew slack.' Then, by detailing the images, smells, and feelings of sitting with their mom through chemotherapy, the student fully conveys her personal stake in this technology and why she is drawn to the topic. Okay, so you know what topic you are interested in studying in college and you have a good story to go with it. So what? Why should the UNC admissions officers care? The final step is to connect your interest to the academic and extracurricular offerings at UNC Chapel Hill. Although this isn’t a 'Why This School' essay that specifically asks for you to mention school resources, the best way to make your essay stand out is to go beyond what you are explicitly asked for and demonstrate the level of research you have done. The word count is limited for this essay, so the majority of your focus should be on telling the story and demonstrating your interest in your chosen topic. However, try and reserve a sentence or two to weave in school-specific offerings. When you are including these opportunities, it’s important to ensure that they are both unique and supported by your personal connection. In other words, don’t just say you’re excited to take Biology 101 at UNC, since every university offers that class—instead, find a more distinctive offering that would be harder to find elsewhere, like Molecular Genetics. Similarly, tie each resource you mention back to yourself. Don’t just say that you want to work with a specific professor; add what you hope to learn from their work with gene replication in mice and how you think you might apply that work to humans, for example. The UNC admissions officers will read thousands of essays where students simply tell their stories and forget to connect their previous experiences to their future ones. When they come across an essay that is able to tell the student’s story and incorporate the school’s offerings, they will be impressed. Everyone loves a little flattery—even colleges. That said, make sure that the one or two school resources you mention naturally flow in the essay. The easiest solution is to add a sentence at the end about how you’ll explore your interests on campus, but this tends to disrupt the flow of the essay and make it feel forced. Below is an example of how to make this idea less jarring: 'If only I could tell my mom about the hours I’ll have spent researching with faculty at the CRISPR Screening Facility at Chapel Hill to develop a new drug that would make chemotherapy a bad dream, and not a reality, for those suffering from leukemia.' If you can successfully unite the topic you’re interested in with the classes, professors, programs, or extracurriculars at UNC, your essay will likely resonate more with the admissions committee.",

This will help them understand how you approach your college decision-making process and how well Notre Dame aligns with your goals.\n\nBrainstorming Questions:\n- What is the one thing you cannot compromise on when choosing a college? Is it a specific academic program, a particular type of campus culture, or something else?\n- Why is this factor so important to you? How has your past experience shaped this priority?\n- How does this non-negotiable factor connect to your future goals or personal values?\n- How will having this factor in your college experience help you succeed or feel at home?\n\nWhat Makes a Good Response:\nA strong response will:\n- Be highly specific: Clearly articulate your non-negotiable factor(s) and avoid vague or generic responses. Explain precisely why this factor is critical to you.\n- Show personal connection: Tie your non-negotiable to your personal experiences, values, or aspirations. Demonstrate how this factor has influenced your past and will shape your future.\n- Align with Notre Dame’s values: While you should be honest, consider how your non-negotiable might fit with Notre Dame’s mission, culture, and offerings. This can subtly show why Notre Dame is a good match for you.\n- Stay focused: Given the 150-word limit, keep your response concise and on-topic. Avoid listing multiple non-negotiables; instead, focus on the one or two that matter most to you.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a good example of the “Global Issues” essay, which has become an increasingly common supplement in recent years. This kind of essay typically asks you to do two things: talk about an issue you’re passionate about, and explain what your interest in that issue has taught you about yourself, or how it has helped you develop certain attributes. The first thing you’ll want to do is pick an issue to write about. Note that this issue can be something close to home, in your own community, or one that affects the entire world. If you do pick a global issue, however, make sure you identify something specific within that broad issue to focus on. For example, tackling climate change as a whole might be too ambitious given the size and scale of that issue. Instead, think about which element of climate change you are most motivated to tackle. Are you heartbroken about the loss of habitat for species that live at the poles? Are you worried about increased cases of heat exhaustion and heatstroke exacerbating the flaws in the American healthcare system? Or are you concerned that the partisanship in the United States government will prevent any bill geared towards promoting green energy from passing? These potential topics are zoomed in on one tiny part of the huge beast that is the climate crisis. That narrower focus will provide more structure for your thoughts, which will result in a more cohesive, easier to follow essay. If you would rather write about a local issue, think about which headlines in your local newspaper grab your attention, or recent conversations you’ve had with your family or neighbors about things going on in the area. Maybe your town, like many in the United States, doesn’t have good public transportation, and you dislike how much space is taken up by parking lots. Or maybe a nearby puppy mill was recently discovered and shut down, but now the animal shelters are overwhelmed. Whatever issue you choose to write about should be one you feel some genuine personal connection to. Maybe your dad is a real estate agent and always complains about an illogical quirk in your town’s zoning laws. You might know a lot about this issue for someone your age, but if you don’t really care about it, your essay will come across as dry and impersonal. So, don’t structure your brainstorming around what will make you seem smart or impressive, as the thing that will actually convey those attributes is highlighting an issue that admissions officers can see is truly near and dear to your heart. The #1 key to writing a strong response is describing your issue in a way that is personal, so that your readers don’t just learn what the issue is, but also how your investment in solving these issues reflects who you are. You’re not a journalist, you’re a college applicant, so ultimately the most important thing to do is teach Richmond admissions officers something substantive about the type of person you are. To do that, you’ll want to rely on personal anecdotes related to the issue you’ve selected. By seeing you in action, so to speak, admissions officers will learn something about how you think, how you work with others, what your primary values are, and so on. If you’ve chosen a local issue, explaining it through specific examples from your own life should hopefully be pretty straightforward. Maybe you write about how your own dog was a rescue, which motivates you to help the puppy-mill dogs find forever homes, as you know that bringing in a rescue dog may present unique challenges, but also brings an unparalleled form of companionship. For a larger scale issue, your example might be more tangentially related, as it’s possible this issue is something you’ve become passionate about just through observation, rather than a direct link to your own life. That’s okay, so long as it’s still clear how we’re getting from point A to B. For example, maybe you’re from Seattle, and write about how the increasingly frequent heat waves, and lack of equal access to something as simple as a fan during these periods, makes you worry about what the future, with consistently extreme heat having more and more severe consequences, will look like. Finally, note that Richmond isn’t just asking you to describe an issue you care about, but also to propose “an action or policy” to help address it. This requirement may seem intimidating at first, but don’t worry–admissions officers aren’t expecting you to enact world peace overnight. They just want to see that you’re able to think critically about an issue and be creative in identifying potential ways to make the world a little better, as that’s a huge part of what you’ll be asked to do in your classes once you arrive on campus. In coming up with your solution, it’s not a bad idea to see if you can draw on your other interests, to both demonstrate your creativity and subtly teach Richmond admissions officers something new about you. For example, maybe you’re a big baseball fan, and propose collaborating with the local team to host a meet-and-greet with players where puppies are also available for adoption. Or, perhaps you’re interested in learning about other cultures, so to offset the negative health effects of extreme heat, you propose a drastic change to the American work schedule–the implementation of a siesta, to allow people to relax when the heat is most intense, like they have long done in areas closer to the equator. If you’re feeling stuck, take a step back from your actual essay, and ask yourself honestly: what would you like to do about this issue? Remember, this is a college essay, not a congressional bill, so you don’t have to worry about other people agreeing with you. You want your solution to make sense, and acknowledge the complexity of your issue–you wouldn’t want to, for example, say that to combat the health consequences of extreme heat we should simply force more people to go to medical school–but as long as you do those two things, there really aren’t any rules about what you can and can’t do.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a good example of an open-ended prompt that can be very appealing at first blush because it allows you the freedom to write about nearly anything. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the possibilities, you can try to organize your thoughts with slightly more direct questions, like the following: What’s one of the most important things you’ve ever learned about yourself? How did you learn it? Think about pivotal moments in your life–times when you felt fundamentally different afterwards. What triggered that massive change in your understanding of yourself? If you don’t want to write directly about yourself, what are some things about the world that you were shocked to learn? Was there a time you were proven wrong about something you believed? How did you react? Keep in mind that whatever unexpected lesson you choose to write about will need to sustain a pretty long essay, so the moment you choose needs to have been genuinely meaningful. Maybe when you were nine you learned that your grandfather once worked for J. D. Rockefeller, but that information, while initially surprising, didn’t do anything to shape your life going forward. Instead, focus on something that had, and continues to have, a real impact on how you understand yourself and the world. It doesn’t have to be something earth-shattering, just significant to you. Maybe that means you write about learning that your childhood home used to be a stop on the Underground Railroad, which gave you a different understanding of how places evolve and influence people differently over time. Or perhaps you describe your shock when you learned that your grandmother had to drop out of high school to immigrate to the U.S. and never completed her degree. You could also think about things that might seem trivial to the average person, but hold a deeper meaning to you. For example, learning that a tomato is a fruit was the catalyst to your passion for experimenting in the kitchen. Or maybe after years of saying you weren’t athletic you learned how thrilling rock climbing was and now it’s a core part of your personality. Your brainstorming process is going to be focused on identifying a moment that taught you something both unexpected and meaningful. The writing process is going to be focused on answering the prompt’s actual question: what did you learn from this experience, and what happened next? While you are being asked to reflect on a moment that happened in the past, your goal here is still the same as in any college essay: to explain why this moment is important in understanding what you’ll be like as a college student. So, you need to connect your realization from your past to who you are now, and who you hope to become in the next four years. As usual, the best way to make that connection is through specific anecdotes and experiences that illustrate what you’re trying to say, as that approach is both more meaningful and more engaging than simply stating, for example, “After learning about my home’s history, I became more aware that the world is a lot bigger than just me.” Instead, this student could write about how, after their realization, they researched the histories of other buildings in their hometowns, and the backstories of famous buildings elsewhere in the country and the world. They could then describe how this process gave them a different awareness of the vastness of the world, but also the power of one person or a group of people to give a certain meaning to a particular place. This much more fleshed out response will show Richmond admissions officers that this student is motivated, curious, and able to draw sophisticated takeaways from complex information, which are all qualities colleges value in their applicants. If you have the space, you can even go a step further, and directly connect the broader lessons you learned to something specific you hope to do at Richmond. For example, this student may write about how they see Richmond’s study abroad program in Rome as the perfect opportunity for them to continue refining their ideas about the connect between individuals and the place they live, as the program includes the course “Ancient City,” which “includes many site visits in and around Rome.” This prompt doesn’t explicitly ask for this school-specific connection, and you can write a strong response without it. However, showing Richmond admissions officers that you already have a concrete sense of how you’d like to take advantage of their school’s opportunities may well be the thing that takes your essay from great to outstanding. One thing you’ll want to avoid is choosing a generic or fake lesson that you learned. The last thing the Richmond admissions officers want to read is another essay about a student who learned “teamwork is important” or “you should never judge a book by its cover”. On that note, they will also be able to tell if you manufacture an “aha” moment for the sake of your essay. Don’t force it; choose a genuine story/lesson and that will result in a stronger essay. As we noted in the “Brainstorming” section, this question is in some ways the least structured of the three, so if you’re really struggling to come up with a good topic, or to describe it in a way that makes sense, don’t beat yourself up. The beauty of option prompts is that you have, well, options. So, there’s no shame at all in pivoting to one of the other two prompts if this one proves to be too tricky.",

        "prompt_text": "Richmond welcomes students from various backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences. What is at least one way you will contribute to our community that is not already mentioned in your application? (350-650 words)",
        "word_limit": "350-650",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a classic example of the common “Diversity” essay, which you’ll likely come across more than once as you knock out your supplements. Or maybe you’ve already responded to this kind of prompt for another school, and are thinking of repurposing that essay here. While you can certainly write about the same topic, and your previous work will streamline your brainstorming and writing processes, this essay is likely quite a bit longer than the one you’ve already written, so you’ll still need to generate some new content. If this is your first time tackling this kind of essay, don’t worry–we’re here to help you figure out exactly what you want to write about! The first thing to note is that the way colleges evaluate race in the admissions process has changed since the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action in 2023. Schools are now only allowed to consider a student’s race in the context of their overall story and background, and the essay is the perfect place to show how your race fits into the broader context of who you are. What this means is that, if your race is an important part of your identity, we’d encourage you to think hard about focusing this response on it, as otherwise Richmond admissions officers will be incredibly limited in their ability to factor your race into their admissions decision. Of course, if you don’t think your race is quite the right topic for you, that’s completely fine. There are many things that comprise our identities, as Richmond underscores by saying that they welcome “students from various backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences.” So, you could write a strong essay about a different aspect of your identity that people typically associate with “diversity,” like your gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on. But you could also write about something more unconventional, like a hobby you’re unusually passionate about, or a particularly formative experience. Topics in this vein could include: The countless hours you’ve spent researching how analytics has changed how baseball teams evaluate their players; Your experience driving the Pacific Coast Highway on your own last summer; Your encyclopedic knowledge of where different cacti species grow, and how large they can become. So long as the thing you choose is genuinely important to understanding who you are overall, you’ll be able to write a strong response about it. The first step to writing a strong response is explaining why this feature of your identity is fundamental to who you are. You should do that using specific anecdotes that show, rather than merely tell, Richmond admissions officers why this quality of yours matters. If you just say “Coming to terms with my sexuality was hard, but ultimately worth it,” they may feel sympathy or pride towards you, but they won’t understand anything about how this process inspired your growth or development. Instead, describe the anxiety you felt at any family gathering when your relatives would ask you if you had a girlfriend yet, and how you felt like a failure when your older brother got engaged to his long-term girlfriend. Then, you can transition into talking about how, during a backpacking trip with him and his fiancée, being away from the world for a few days made you feel comfortable enough to come out for the first time, and their immediate acceptance and love helped start to wash away your feelings of inferiority. Because this is an unusually long supplement, take the time to really let your story breathe. Don’t just give an overview of what happened. Instead, use strong descriptive language to fully flesh out your thoughts and feelings. Depending on what you’re writing about, some of those thoughts and feelings may still be quite raw, so keep in mind that, while showing vulnerability speaks well of your self-awareness and overall emotional maturity, you don’t need to bare your soul to a bunch of strangers. Only go as deep as you’re comfortable with. You also want to make sure you’re addressing both pieces of the prompt. You don’t want to just describe this one feature of your identity, but also explain how it will help you contribute to Richmond’s campus community. That means admissions officers need to understand not just that your identity encompasses this one feature, but also what this one feature says about who you are as a whole. Because you have a lot of space to work with, ideally you should also connect what you’ve learned from having this particular quality to a specific club, program, or even academic offering at Richmond. Your goal in this essay is to describe how one particular aspect of your identity has been especially important in shaping who you are, and who you will become at Richmond, and the best way to do that is by making a concrete connection between this feature of yourself and the school. For example, the hypothetical student described above may talk about how his experience coming out to his brother taught him how empowering it is to have even one person on your side. And because he also knows how risky it feels to take that first step, at Richmond he hopes to become an URWELL Peer Educator, so that he can help promote “healthy behaviors through outreach and educational programs.” If he were to instead just say something general, like “I will draw on this experience whenever I interact with my peers, to ensure they feel supported even if I don’t know what they’re going through,” most of the work of envisioning him as a Richmond student is being left up to the admissions officers, as what he described is something he could do at any college. By citing a school-specific resource that will help him achieve this goal of supporting his peers, he paints a clear picture of himself as an empathetic, engaged member of the Richmond community.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This is a good example of the popular “Diversity” essay, which you may have already come across in another school’s supplemental essay package. This kind of essay requires you to do two things: highlight some particular aspect of your identity, and then explain why it’s fundamental to understanding who you are as a whole. Before we go further, it’s important to note that this kind of essay may carry more significance for certain applicants in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning affirmative action. Colleges are now banned from directly factoring an applicant’s race into their admissions decision, but they are allowed to consider race in the context of your overall background and experiences. What that means is that, if your race is an important part of your identity, you should think about focusing this essay on it, as otherwise UVA admissions officers will be legally unable to consider your race as part of their holistic review process. If your racial identity doesn’t feel like quite the right topic for this essay, there are also plenty of other options out there. You could write about your gender, sexuality, ethnicity, or other qualities people often associate with the word “diversity,” but you can also broaden your net, and write about, to use UVA’s words “any past experience or part of your background that has shaped your perspective.” Our past experiences and backgrounds are not just the demographic boxes we check, but also our interests, hobbies, and favorite memories. So, if you want to write about your family’s yearly camping trips during the summer, or your experience planting your own herb garden, that is completely fine, so long as those topics have been influential in making you who you are. Finally, note that UVA wants you to write about something that “will serve as a source of strength.” That means you should focus on some aspect of your identity that makes you feel empowered. Our identities are complicated, so that doesn’t mean you need to have strictly positive experiences with this part of yourself. You do want your overall framing to be positive, however, as if you only talk about how frustrating it was when your herbs kept dying, UVA admissions officers may not understand how you’re going to draw strength from this experience in college. Instead, touch on your frustration briefly, and then dive into how rewarding it was for you to see them thrive after you built a short protective wall to shield them from the worst of the wind. In your actual response, it’s crucial that you don’t just describe what this especially important aspect of your identity is, but also explain why this quality is so fundamental to your personality as a whole. In other words, what have you learned about yourself as a result of your experiences connected to this part of your identity? Like in any college essay, the most engaging, informative way of answering that question is by showing, not telling. What that means is rather than just saying “Being raised trilingual taught me the importance of being truly open to other ways of thinking,” describe a moment when this realization shaped your actions. For example, maybe you once had to act as an impromptu translator at the supermarket, as a Japanese couple was having issues with their card but couldn’t communicate with the cashier. As you bounced back and forth between languages, you realized that certain things are impossible to say in exactly the same way, due to the drastic differences between Japanese and English. That in turn made you realize that language isn’t just words that passively come out of our mouths, but something that shapes how we engage with the word around us. With the original, tell-y line, UVA admissions officers don’t get any detail about what being open to other ways of thinking means in the context of your particular life, so you aren’t doing anything to set yourself apart from other applicants who may also have this value. In the more detailed, show-y example on the other hand, readers get to see how your broader takeaway has manifested in your daily life, which helps them better understand how this aspect of your identity will help you fit into their broader campus community. The most common mistake students make with this kind of essay is focusing too much on the particular feature of their identity they’ve chosen, and not fulfilling the second goal of this kind of essay by connecting it to their broader personality. In the context of the above example, that might look like diving into great detail about when you learned your three languages and how long it took you to consider yourself fluent, but not incorporating any information about how this ability has shaped their worldview.

An effective essay for this prompt will achieve the following goals: Highlight your authentic reasons for wanting to attend the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Highlight your authentic reasons for wanting to study your major of choice. The word 'authentic' above is very important—one of the biggest mistakes students make in this type of essay prompt is writing a generic essay that could just as easily have been written about the University of Minnesota at Twin Cities, or the University of Michigan. This is the single biggest pet peeve for admissions officers, as they strongly prefer students that have specific reasons for choosing their university. They also want to ensure that students are passionate about their chosen major, not just pursuing the one that will lead to the highest paying or most prestigious jobs after graduation. With this prompt, your goal is to give admissions officers concrete reasons why UW Madison is an especially good match for you, as well as specific reasons why you love your major. Consider beginning your essay with a story about how you discovered UW Madison and decided to apply. For example, you could write the following introduction if you decided to apply to UW Madison after visiting the campus: 'I wasn’t used to the snow. In fact, this was the first time I ever experienced a snowfall. It doesn’t really happen where I’m from—a small town in Mississippi. Then again, so much of what I saw at the University of Wisconsin at Madison during my snowy campus visit doesn’t happen where I’m from either.' Then, highlight unique aspects of the university that appeal to you, and be holistic with what you talk about. Study the UW Madison website in detail, watch videos of campus tours and student reviews, and visit if possible. Find the names of one extracurricular and one part of campus where you can imagine yourself spending lots of time. Then, weave them into your writing. The strongest essays are deeply personal, so connect the campus to yourself.",

        "word_limit": "200-400 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "The prompt falls under the Diversity Essay archetype, which means Vanderbilt wants to learn how your background or identity has impacted your worldview and, in turn, your approach to life. Colleges use this prompt because they want to build classes that are diverse along many dimensions, not just the standard ones people associate with diversity. What makes your background diverse could be your race and ethnicity, gender, language, socioeconomic class, illness and disability, country of origin, culture, religion, or even interests or hobbies. Think about these factors and identify the different communities you’re a part of. Remember to consider aspects of your identity like competing on a team or even participation in an internet forum – even if these features may seem silly, our hobbies and personal passions can be just as meaningful as more traditional communities, and can sometimes even do more to set you apart, as other students are less likely to write about them. The only thing that matters is choosing something that has significantly impacted your development. Then, consider the emotions you feel about being part of that community, or claiming that identity, and any personality traits you might have developed as a result. Alternatively, do you have any distinctive skills or talents because of your background? Brainstorm two to three formative or otherwise significant experiences you’ve had because of your membership in this community to help you get inspired. A quick note if you intend to write about your racial background: in June 2023, the United States Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling, however, still allows colleges to consider race on an individual basis, which is one reason many schools are now including diversity prompts as one of their supplemental essay prompts. If you feel that your racial background has impacted you significantly, this is the place to discuss that. Of course, you are more than welcome to discuss something else, but do be aware that if you don’t discuss your racial background here (or in your personal statement), Vanderbilt will be unable to factor that aspect of your identity into their decision. Regardless of which attribute of diversity you choose, you should strive for individuality and specificity in your response. Remember, college essays are an opportunity to showcase your unique life perspective. You don’t want to waste this opportunity by writing down some bland dictionary definitions or cliché statements. Instead, think of what diversity means to you personally, and some aspect of your life that reflects that value. From there, think of personal anecdotes or stories about how diversity has contributed to your growth or development as a person – remember that showing, rather than simply telling, your points will make your essay much more compelling. Follow the advice below in order to avoid common mistakes: Don’t solely write about negative experiences. You may have had negative experiences as a result of your background or identity. While it’s generally fine to mention adversity, college essays usually want to see a positive outcome or lesson at the conclusion, to make your story one of growth and resilience, rather than solely hardship. Example: “Growing up as a first-generation Egyptian-American, I always felt out of place, and struggled to balance the expectations of my parents with the reality of being raised in the U.S. I remember being embarrassed when they spoke to me in Arabic in front of my friends, which made me want to distance myself from my culture. I never really fit in with the other kids at school, and this made me feel isolated. Because of these struggles, I developed a strong sense of independence and learned how to take care of myself. However, these experiences have also left me feeling disconnected from both my Egyptian roots and American culture. At Vanderbilt, I hope to find a community where I finally feel like I belong and can start fresh.” Although this writer does briefly touch on independence and self-sufficiency, which are positive traits, and vaguely gestures at hoping for a fresh start at Vanderbilt, the overall tone of the essay is negative. As a result, admissions officers may wonder what they took away from this experience that will allow them to thrive in college. There are a few different ways this student could fix this problem. For example, they could spend more time fleshing out the positive qualities they developed as a result of this experience, or they could go into more detail about the community they’re hoping to find at Vanderbilt, by citing particular clubs or programs that they think will help them find the community they’ve been missing. Don’t use a cliché topic like immigration, traveling, or moving. These events are very common, and it’s fine if they’re part of your background, but don’t make the entire essay centered around these clichés. Example: “My journey as an immigrant from Mexico to the United States has shaped every aspect of who I am today. When I was six years old, my family moved to the U.S. in search of a better life. We faced many challenges, including learning a new language, adapting to a different culture, and dealing with financial hardships. Despite these obstacles, my parents always encouraged me to work hard and never give up on my dreams. Their sacrifices motivated me to excel in school and become the first person in my family to attend college. I am proud of my heritage and the hard work it took to get here. At Vanderbilt, I plan to continue this journey of success and make my parents proud by achieving great things. I hope to join cultural organizations that celebrate diversity and share my story with others to inspire them to overcome their own challenges. My experiences as an immigrant have taught me resilience, and I am eager to bring this determination to Vanderbilt.” Of course, we don’t want to discount how impactful immigrating to a new country can be. The problem is not that the experience isn’t meaningful enough – rather, it’s that many other people have had a similar one, and taken away similar lessons from it. Instead of focusing on these clichés, you could briefly provide context about immigrating from Mexico, and then focus on a less common aspect of your experience and give a more personal takeaway. For example, you could talk about how playing soccer with the kids in your neighborhood gave you a shared cultural touchpoint that was invaluable as you were acclimating to life in the US. Don’t write a laundry list of identities and demographics. Like we already said, this prompt isn’t just about who you are; it’s about what you’ve experienced that made you who you are, and how you see the world because of this part of yourself. Make sure to provide deeper analysis – most of the essay should be about your reflections and growth, and the evolution of your worldview, not just the traits themselves. Remember – quality over quantity. Example: “My identity is a combination of many different aspects. I am a first-generation Vietnamese-American, a daughter of immigrant parents, and a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community. I also come from a low-income background, which has taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. Additionally, I’m a female student who is passionate about pursuing a career in STEM, a field where women are often underrepresented. Each of these identities has played a role in shaping who I am today. Being Vietnamese-American has connected me to my cultural roots, while my experience as a first-generation college student motivates me to succeed. My LGBTQ+ identity has taught me to embrace who I am, and my low-income background has given me the determination to overcome obstacles. I believe that all these aspects of my identity will allow me to contribute to the diversity at Vanderbilt.” Because this student is so focused on covering all aspects of her identity, we get only a shallow understanding of each one’s significance to her broader life. If she were to have instead focused on just, say, being part of the LGBTQ+ community, she would have had room to provide examples of how she came to accept this part of herself, for example by describing her friends’ kindness when she came out to them. We know there’s more than one feature of your life you’ll want to highlight in your response, and leaving things out can feel frustrating. But unfortunately, word counts are an unavoidable part of the college application process. Generally, you should only briefly introduce the culture, background, community, or other driver of the values you’re exploring in your essay. You should be specific and clear about which community or group you’re referencing, but you then want to quickly dive deep into its impact on your life as a whole. This deep dive should make up most of your essay. Analyze your current and past emotions about this aspect of your identity, and how it has shaped your worldview. With the limited word count, prioritize including information about the impact of your values and background over the mere nature or description of your identity. Finally, given Vanderbilt’s inclusion of their “dare to grow” motto, you should demonstrate how your background has emboldened you to grow personally, and how it will continue to do so at Vanderbilt. Think about times you exhibited leadership or kindness, or took a risk, and connect these instances to the part of your identity you’re focusing on. A growth-oriented mindset is key here, so be sure to highlight the way your background helped you evolve in your personal values, ambitions, and accomplishments. Also note that the prompt specifically asks you to relate your chosen background to possible contributions to the Vanderbilt community. Depending on what you’re writing about, it might be beneficial to research extracurricular campus groups at Vanderbilt or in the Nashville area that align with your identity. Including these specific details demonstrates your deep interest in the school, and commitment to being an active member of its tightly knit community.",

Avoid vague generalities and consider starting off your essay with a lively, brief anecdote to bring your story to life. Many applicants may write about posts they shared or reposted on social media during times of social crisis. Although these are valuable forms of activism to raise awareness on important issues, you will need to choose something more impactful for this essay. Have you ever organized or attended a protest for a cause you are passionate about? Was there a time you wrote letters to your local representatives or spoke up during a town hall meeting? Here are some questions to consider as you brainstorm: Advocacy specifically refers to the act of speaking on the behalf of or in support of another person, place, or thing. How did you speak up? Whose voices have you amplified? Example: A student writes about her experience organizing a walkout at her school for the 2018 March for Our Lives to bring the issue of gun control front and center to her school district. What community service work have you done? Who did this work serve, and how did it help bring them closer to justice? Remember, your response doesn’t have to be directly related to the social, economic, racial or political justice of human beings; advocacy for animals and the environment counts as well! Example: A student illustrates how his family’s tradition of volunteering at a soup kitchen every Thanksgiving has sparked a passion in him to research and combat food insecurity and food deserts in the US in his city. Are you a part of a group that has historically suffered injustice? How have you advocated for yourself and your community? Example: A Native American student from the Zuni Reservation in New Mexico narrates the injustices her community has faced in cultural erasure. She creates content on social media to increase awareness of her tribe’s rich history and fading language. As a word of caution, if you choose this prompt, don’t fall into the trap of sounding like a savior. Sometimes students will feel the need to embellish to impress admissions officers, but that often backfires. For example, don’t act like you’ve achieved peace in the Middle East after organizing an assembly at your school to educate your fellow students on the conflict in response to protests taking place. Remember to stay humble and drive home the impact you’ve had on your community—even if it was in one small way—rather than the whole world. The most important thing to remember when approaching this prompt is to focus on an issue that really resonated with you. Sometimes social media can make it seem like there is a right and wrong way to approach activism – stay true to yourself! The way you advocate for equity and justice in your community may differ from other applicants. Allow these differences to let you stand out and illustrate what you’re truly passionate about.",

Villanova is a university rooted in community, service, and moral development, so you’d ideally choose a lesson that reflects these values. To help you brainstorm, consider this list of questions. In your life, have you had any pivotal moments, challenges, successes, or experiences that changed your perspective? Has anything happened to you that changed you, your values, or how you see the world? If you can’t think of anything specific, try thinking of a value you hold and reflect on where that value comes from. What is a belief or lesson that’s deeply important to you? Where does it come from? Why is it important? Are there any lessons you’ve learned or beliefs you hold that mesh especially well with Villanova’s mission? To begin, focus mainly on generating as many ideas as possible–it’s better to have too many options than too few, as having too many means you can honestly evaluate which is the strongest. Then you can trim them down based on the following considerations. First, you’ll want to pick something unique. Villanova admissions officers will be reading hundreds of essays, and you want yours to stand out from the crowd. While it’s practically impossible to write about something they’ve absolutely never seen before, there are some topics that are widely known cliches, like learning to persevere after losing a sports game. In addition to being authentic, you also want to provide Villanova with a comprehensive sense of who you are, so pick a lesson with some depth. It might shed light on where you come from, what you value, or how you live your life. Combining authenticity with personal meaning will make for the most compelling essays. Another powerful choice is to pick a story that connects to your future, particularly your future at Villanova.

Additionally, we recommend sticking with only a few talking points in this essay, as your space is limited and you may want to draw from personal experiences to explain how your past work will make you a great addition to the school. In short, how can you make this campus better? How can you stand out, and how can you fit in? Keep your writing specific, concise, and highly personalized.",

First, you need to choose an aspect of your identity or background, ideally one you haven’t yet had a chance to dive into elsewhere in your application. Then, you will discuss a time you were misjudged because of this aspect of yourself, and how you responded or what you learned from this experience. Let’s break down each of those pieces. Usually, in writing about identity, you would want to choose a feature of yourself that is important to you and/or affects how you see the world. For this prompt specifically, however, you may want to channel your brainstorming less towards what’s important to your own self-image, and more towards features of your identity that affect how others see you. Of course, there may well be overlap between the two, but if you aren’t sure where to start, the latter category is a better jumping off point. If you’ve experienced prejudice in the form of racism, sexism, homophobia, or something of the sort, this is a good place to talk about it, but you also don’t have to have experienced bigotry to answer this prompt effectively.",

With just 250 words to work with, it’s important to select the right anecdote, so let’s talk about what that looks like. To start, you’ll want a strong, specific story. While you might “lend your strength” every day, you want to be able to anchor this ability in a particular event or moment, as that will make your story more compelling and memorable than a vague description that could blur together with someone else’s essay. Details are key, so make sure you pick an occasion that you can vividly describe. You also want to choose one that will stand out as unique to you–avoid cliché stories like supporting a teammate while they rehabbed an injury or helping your friend with their homework during a challenging history unit. Ideally, your story should also show initiative. In other words, a story where you went out of your way to lend your strength to someone will make a bigger impact than one where they had to ask you for help.",

With a word count of only 120 words, there is little room to be too detailed, but it’s still enough to fully and effectively answer the prompt. When brainstorming for this prompt, you’ll want to consider the extracurricular activities and community service activities that have been the most meaningful for you. Think about any longstanding involvements you have with a service-based club, organization, or activism project, situations in which you showed true altruism, activities you do that have a positive impact on your community, and your dedication to social change or justice. However, make sure to avoid short-term projects and stand-alone events. Deep involvement, ideally over several years, is what reflects genuine commitment to your cause. A weeklong Habitat for Humanity trip or an afternoon working at the local food bank don’t pack much of a punch on their own. That said, sometimes a shorter term involvement, or even a single-day event, can make a big impact on you. If that’s true for you, you can discuss those experiences—just make sure to clearly connect them to your deeper commitments and values. Then, demonstrate how your involvement in this specific community has shaped your development. A great way to do this is to show who you were (through thoughts, feelings, emotions, or physicalities) before you joined this community, and who you are now as a result. Finally, include how your values will continue shaping your life in the future, and maybe even demonstrate how you would positively contribute to the Virginia Tech community; admissions officers should be able to clearly see why this story matters for understanding what kind of college student you’ll be. This final piece is where you will convince admissions officers you are the right fit for the campus community. There is not one right answer, as this is highly personal to each individual. The way to approach this is to be as specific as possible about what you want to do on campus. Make sure, however, that you can back up whatever you say with the rest of your application. You do not have to find a unique program that you think would make you stand out if it’s not something that connects to the community you were previously a part of. Avoid the following common mistakes made with this archetype: Don’t use a privileged or pretentious tone. You don’t want to cast yourself as some kind of savior, or the people you helped as existing only to help you learn about yourself. Don’t come to a cliché conclusion. Be original in sharing your experience. Cliché messages like “I learned that people can be happy with so little” or “I learned the importance of giving back” are red flags of inauthenticity. Don’t be detached or impersonal. Make sure to write about the impact you made, what you felt, and your personal experience throughout. Being vulnerable, and acknowledging and uncertainty or discomfort you felt, typically makes your essay stronger, and those sentiments are evidence of true growth. Don’t focus too much on the “what,” but rather the “why” and “how.” More than just what you did, describe why you did it, and how it connects to your learning and personal growth. Don’t use a generic or overused example like volunteering at a soup kitchen or picking up litter unless you have a genuinely unique perspective or narrative. For example, maybe you started doing deliveries from the soup kitchen on your bike, to reach people who were unable to travel there, or you started creating found art with some of the pieces of litter you found. Whatever it is that you want to continue doing in college, try to find the corresponding club or organization within Virginia Tech that you would join. Once again, this will help tie your individual goals with that of the university and show that you really spent time looking into them.",

They want to see your problem-solving and leadership skills, as well as how this experience shaped your understanding of inclusion. When considering an experience of exclusion or discrimination, think about common markers of identity, such as race, ethnicity, culture, gender and sexual orientations, socioeconomic classes, illnesses and disabilities, or even interests and hobbies, in addition to aspects like language barriers and personal dispositions. Did any of these have an impact on how or why you or someone else was being excluded? Remember, your essay does not have to be about a serious or severe incident to be good. If you have experienced a profound instance of discrimination, then you can absolutely write about that and how you worked to overcome it. However, it can also be something more routine or accidental, like a student at your school who struggled with English or a quiet friend who is sometimes left out of conversations.

Examples of tangible connections might be the Theater in Education class you’re excited to take because it perfectly combines the passion for theater you developed in high school with your dream of being an English teacher. Another connection could be a beloved campus tradition you are aching to participate in, like Project Pumpkin or Lovefeast. You could also discuss the campus culture you observed when you went for a tour, where you saw students collaborating and helping each other study on Hearn Plaza (Something like this also answers the part of the prompt asking about contact you’ve had with the school!). Keep these tips in mind when you’re writing about tangible connections: Choose reasons that are unique to Wake Forest. Every school has an Introduction to Economics class or study abroad program. However, classes like The Italian Experience in America or Psychology of Memory are far less common. You will have more of an impact if you actually establish a connection. If you want to participate in the Wake ‘N Shake dance marathon, explain how you planned fundraisers for organizations in high school, and how you now want to give to the Wake Forest community. Don’t name-drop! Probably the most important tip is to elaborate on the connections you make to the University. Explain why you are interested in joining this specific club, or how studying with this professor will enhance your overall college experience. Quality over quantity is everything. The admissions committee will learn far more about you if you discuss two or three things that relate to your interests and experiences, rather than list ten different classes and clubs you want to join without any elaboration on any of them.",

Despite what you choose, the important thing is to demonstrate your intellect and broader way of thinking. Whether you’re sharing something you are passionate about or something that shapes your perspective, you need to make sure the admissions officers walk away knowing that you are a thoughtful student. If you choose to write about something that piques your intellectual curiosity, the topic you pick is incredibly important. Think about what interests you—something you could talk about for hours on end, or something you desperately want to find the answer to. Asking yourself these questions will help you come up with a topic that you can delve deeper into. You want to be sure your topic is not only exciting to you, but also that it can be connected to something more personal and intellectual. For instance, a student who is fascinated by Latin American culture could discuss her interest in the Carnival celebrations of Brazil and how learning about these celebrations has helped her to connect with her Brazilian roots, as well as to the world history surrounding those roots. Alternatively, a student could use this essay as an opportunity to discuss his favorite hobby. For example, a student who loves to collect coins could discuss how the sheer volume of coins produced fascinates him, how he’s gotten to meet people across the country because of his collection, and how coins have helped him develop a deeper understanding of the financial underpinnings of America. Whatever route you decide to take in this essay, make sure you truly express the nuances of your fascination with the topic.

Have you ever been part of a team, group, or organization where you worked with people from different cultural, socioeconomic, or ideological backgrounds? Did you ever have a conversation or experience that significantly challenged your preconceptions or broadened your perspective? Can you recall a situation where you had to mediate or facilitate understanding between people with differing viewpoints? How did this experience change your outlook or approach to collaboration and leadership? What specific aspects of Wellesley’s community, culture, or programs appeal to you, and how do you see yourself engaging with them based on your past experiences? As you develop your idea, try to pick something personal and unique, that will really show your personality, interests, and best qualities. Think creatively about what might constitute a difference between you and another – it could be a difference of race, culture, sexuality, or gender, but it could also be a difference of hobbies, passions, values, or family structures. Finally, an especially effective essay will demonstrate growth. You don’t want to just state that you have certain positive qualities today, but also give admissions officers a sense of how you developed them.

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "This essay presents a fantastic opportunity to showcase both your intellectual vitality and your social skills. At its core, it’s an essay about your growth as a thinker and person. We disagree with people often, often multiple times a day, so there’s plenty of material to brainstorm from. This may be especially pertinent for members of argument-based extracurriculars, like debate, Mock Trial, and Model UN students. Activists and researchers, too. But remember— it doesn’t have to be an argument, just a discussion with a dissenter. Write down a list of possible topics, and don’t worry too much about the context of the discussion so much as its content and impact. When this essay is well-written, quarrels with the woman in front of you in line for grocery checkout can be just as fascinating as a national debate closing argument. Also, determining whether an issue is “important” or not can be a subjective matter. Your essay doesn’t necessarily need to be about traditional political debate topics, such as abortion or gun control. In fact, we encourage you to write about issues that will be a little less common, if you can think of some relevant experiences (local issues can be especially promising). Topics such as cultural appropriation, the ethics of thrifting and reselling, or whether your school district should get rid of its gifted program are all fair game. Just remember that Yale is a liberal university, so you don’t want to alienate your audience by sharing that you have a particularly conservative point of view. After creating your list, scan your potential topic ideas for varied points of interest. Pay special attention to the second half of the prompt and consider which experiences either helped you sharpen your reasoning or change your opinion. Which experience was the most transformative? Intellectually stimulating? Emotional? Unique? Which do you remember the most clearly and why? Once you’ve narrowed down your options into a few viable ones, pick the one that you feel will make it easiest to craft a compelling story. When starting this essay, include just enough to set the scene. Don’t dwell on exposition, irrelevant details of the conversation, or negative emotions surrounding the event for too long. Who was there? How did you disagree, and why? Introduce each viewpoint as succinctly as possible while still preserving important details, keeping in mind the strict word count. Explain the important points within the conversation before fully diving into the essay. Often essays around any sort of challenge are better-written when the writer focuses on the growth aspects of the story rather than whatever challenging circumstances came before. Really dive into how your thinking was shifted or augmented by your experience or even what broader lessons you may have learned after better understanding a specific issue. What did you do during or after the discussion? Did you research it more deeply or take action in support of your final opinion? For example, maybe your environmental club thought that your school should ban plastic straws because of their negative impact on the planet, but then you learned from disabled students how important plastic straws can be for accessibility. As a result, you shifted the campaign to introducing a composting system instead, and learned the importance of inviting more diverse voices to weigh in on the club’s initiatives. By the end of the argument, your reader should feel that you’ve truly gotten to know your topic well and experienced positive change as a result. Feel free to mention specific logical progressions, newfound evidence, or novel philosophical perspectives you’ve discovered. This essay is also an exercise in open-mindedness, so make sure to avoid ad hominem attacks against your “opponent.” As a general rule of thumb, frame your viewpoint throughout as a respectful one, regardless of how the discussion actually went.",

        "word_limit": "400 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "With this prompt, admissions officers are trying to learn what is important to you in a community and why you are important in a community. Yale’s essay prompts have historically stressed the importance of community, as it’s an understandable priority for them. When applying to a university, you are applying to join their community—so think about what they want! They want to accept students who form deep bonds, care for their peers, and have strong guiding values and principles. This essay allows you to show that you are already well-versed in forming meaningful connections. Most people are a part of various communities, whether they realize it or not or whether these communities are formal (town, soccer team, religious organization, school) or informal (group of friends, coworkers, family) ones. If you are having trouble identifying which yours are, consider which people you feel a sense of community with. Volunteer groups, families, cultures, and clubs may spring to mind. Really, though, anything can make the cut: your Dungeons and Dragons group, those sharing your gender or sexual identity, people with similar life experiences to you. You can aim to organize your essay in the following way: First, define and describe the community you are writing about. Defining the community is especially important for applicants writing about informal communities. For example, if you are writing about your siblings, make sure that this is clear. When describing the community, be sure to describe the culture. How do you interact as a group? For example, your soccer team may be more than teammates – perhaps you have special moments while traveling on the bus for a match. Make sure you discuss the dynamic. As a group, are you sarcastic, silly, or serious? Does your community have a specific kind of humor or tradition? To draw readers into your story, feel free to lead with a charming sensory anecdote, like that of your family cooking their favorite traditional dish or the roars of laughter emerging from gameplay. In just a few sentences, show your reader just how important this community is to you and in which ways you feel connected to it. Do they make you laugh harder or understand you better than anyone else? Do you feel particularly passionate about an issue they represent? Secondly, discuss your engagement with the community. You can lead by introducing your motivation for your efforts to explain them. For example, did you create a Snapchat group chat for your debate team that allowed you to bond outside the context of serious competitions, opening up a channel for close friendship among teammates? Did you regularly grab lunch with your co-workers at a local bakery? Or, did you meet survivors of gender-based violence through your work with a local organization? In this way, your efforts and their meaning can be covered in one fell swoop. Describing your role in your community will allow admissions officers to get a more full picture of what you value and how you act on your values. Finally, reflect on why your involvement was important to you, and how it’s shaped you. For example, did the Snapchat group chat teach you to empathize with your competition, improving your sportsmanship? Did conversations with your coworkers over lunch spark your interest in food science? Or, did volunteering at a non-profit increase your interest in being a human rights lawyer? You could also talk about how being the oldest sibling taught you to be a caretaker and sparked your interest in becoming a doctor. Regardless, you want to write about how you have become who you are through your engagement with this community. Although this essay presents an opportunity to show off what you’ve done, there should be just as much emphasis—if not more so—on your personal connection to your achievements as on your achievements themselves. Remember that admissions officers will already be looking over your activities and awards information, so there’s a good chance they’ll see it soon before or after reading your essays! Take this chance to display your core values, because in a way, this prompt is asking a sub-question: What is meaningful to you?",

        "word_limit": "500-750 words",
        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "Hakarat HaTov is the Hebrew term for gratitude, and quite literally translates to 'recognizing the good' which is an appropriate beginning for a prompt asking for you to write a letter of thanks. This prompt has some overlap with Common App prompt number four, where you are asked to write about a moment of gratitude. However, because Yeshiva University does not accept undergraduate applications via Common App, you would be able to borrow ideas from that essay if you’ve already written it. However, note that there are several differences between the both prompts, so you will have to change a few elements of your essay. In terms of deciding whether this prompt is right for you—if you have a particularly impactful person in your life, then this prompt may be the perfect opportunity for you to express your gratitude to them, and in turn, share your story to the admissions officers. Keep in mind that while this is a letter to someone else, you ultimately want to share information about you, so only pick this prompt if you have an engaging story related to someone who helped you a lot along the way. The best way to approach this essay is to write it as if you were actually writing a thank you note to the person you have chosen, starting with 'Dear so-and-so,…'. Be specific about the ways in which they have helped you and how their guidance has impacted your life. You can also mention your accomplishments, but only if it is relevant to the story you are telling. For example, when writing about an impactful English teacher you could write something along the lines of: 'When you took us on a field trip to see a production of Hamlet which had recast Ophelia as a man, you challenged me to reconsider how societal standards, which I like to think I’m able to transcend, unavoidably impact my interpretation of literature.' The goal of this essay is to express your gratitude in a way that is both genuine and personal and at the same time share your own value system and how it has been shaped by your mentor. If you do this, you will have a strong essay that will help you stand out from the crowd. Commonly, students choose to only discuss the positive aspects of the person they are thanking without sharing any details about themselves. But in fact, admissions officers want to learn more about you and your core values, rather than about the person you are writing about. To avoid this common mistake, it’s important to re-read your essay and ask yourself two questions: Am I only talking about the other person? Have I used details to show how this person has influenced me? Many students also do not provide enough details on how specifically their mentor has influenced them. Ideally you should provide 1-2 anecdotes that share memories of experiences you have had with these people and lessons you have learned along the way. Instead of generic pleasantries, you want to share specific experiences where this person really made a difference in your life. Ask yourself, How did they support you? How did they show they believed in you? How did this impact you? All in all, keep in mind the following key items to write a stellar response: Share anecdotes about experiences you have had with your person, but more importantly, demonstrate that you have learned and grown from these experiences. Be specific. Don’t just say that someone helped you 'achieve your goals.' Instead, share specific examples of how they helped you. Be personal. This is not a time to be boastful. Instead, focus on the ways in which the person you have chosen has impacted your life in a positive way. Show that you are self-aware and humble and truly grateful for what your person has taught you.",

        "prompt_specific_guidelines": "The goal of this prompt is to explain how you see the world today and how you would use your unique background, knowledge, and skills to change it for the better. For example, a student could have faced a personal health challenge in their childhood which led to a strenuous fight for their life, but at the same time, embroiled themselves and family in a year-long battle with their insurance company over refused payments. They are now motivated to engage in political activism to reform the existing healthcare system and advocate for affordable healthcare. This prompt would be right for you if you’ve had a personal struggle, have been involved in an important societal movement, and are motivated to make a change. That being said, the scale of impact you have doesn’t have to be at the state or national level; even talking about impacting your immediate community would suffice as long as the impact you are making is meaningful to you. A good response would keep in mind the following: Tell a story. Build an understanding for the reader about your perspective on the current state of the world and your place in it. Build a connection. Use imagery and other literary devices to help the reader appreciate the personal connection you have with this topic. Identify an opportunity. Be sure to specifically tell the reader what you are trying to change in the world. Advertise your expertise. Tell the reader how you are uniquely qualified to make this change in the world by sharing your knowledge and skills that you have honed from experience. Be specific. Clarify how specifically you will make a difference in the world. Because this response is similar in length to the Common App essay, you should have plenty of room to tell us your story with details that can win the reader over and help them understand why you care so much about this specific topic. Choosing a topic is only half the battle; convincing the reader of the importance of the topic is crucial. Take your time sharing an anecdote to describe the topic’s importance to you, but also save room to explain how you’d like to make an impact and change the world for the better. You want to make sure that the problem is truly actionable and meaningful to the world. Furthermore, you would want the impact you have to be relevant to your own background so admissions officers can learn more about. For example, you may want to avoid talking about building an interplanetary defense system to protect against asteroids from hitting Earth if you are applying for an arts major because it’s not really a hugely current societal problem and it’s definitely not relevant to your background. Another common mistake you should avoid is being too general about the impact you would make. Students may find themselves writing 'with my newfound leadership skills, I can make an impact on the team.' This provides no clarity on which leadership skills you have honed nor what kind of impact they can have on the team. Rather, you should focus on explaining what about your background makes you fit for making an impact and how you plan to leverage these towards accomplishing your specific goals.",

Instead, focus on 1-3 specific events or experiences that 'had' a significant impact on your life. This could be a personal challenge you overcame, a time you learned something important about yourself, or an accomplishment you are proud of. Get creative with the introduction and provide some context as to what moment in your life that we are reading about. Remember that you’re writing page 613, not page 10. A lot should’ve happened between now and this page in your autobiography. Dream big! Be specific and provide details. Don’t just tell the reader what happened. Show them. Use vivid language and imagery to bring your story to life. The more specific you can be, the more memorable your story will be. It’s hard to imagine yourself in the moment, especially when that moment never happened, but the more you can picture your future self the more accurate and entertaining this page in your autobiography will become. Be honest and authentic. This is your autobiography, so don’t be afraid to be yourself. Share your true thoughts and feelings, even if they are not always positive. Colleges want to get to know the real you, so don’t be afraid to let your personality shine through.",

Ultimately, the admissions officers are looking to understand more about your character, your thought processes, and how you handle conflicts or challenges. This prompt is very similar to the Common App prompt # 3. However, because the Yeshiva undergraduate application is not on the Common Application, you should be okay to borrow ideas from that essay if you’ve already written it, however, the prompts are slightly different so don’t just copy and paste your essay over. A good way to open the essay—and really, almost any personal essay—is to tell an anecdote. That helps draw the reader in and engage them in the narrative you are telling. In this case, you might start with the incident itself, or, if you are describing a long incident or series of experiences, a particular moment. You have more than enough space in this response to nail down the specific details. More importantly though, you want to describe how the experience affected you. Remember, the essay is less about the specific experience and more about what it reveals about your character and your value system. Provide substantial analysis that shows how you responded: What did you feel while you were doing what you did, and how did you feel afterwards? Did the challenge make you defensive? Did it prompt you to question your beliefs or seek out more information? Ultimately, the essay should showcase your ability to grow and learn from challenging experiences. Whether or not your belief changed, reflect on what you learned from the experience and how it has shaped you as a person. Finally, remember that authenticity is crucial. Write in your own voice and be honest about your experiences and reflections. Don’t try to present yourself as having all the answers, but rather as someone who is open to growth and learning.",

The goal of this prompt is to understand your interest in your selected major and how your background supports that major. If you’re undecided, that’s totally fine (as the prompt even says!), but you’ll still need to explain your interest in the potential major you selected on your application. A good essay would introduce the major, articulate the core reason(s) that you are interested in this major, give specific examples from both inside and outside the classroom of your positive experiences with the subject, and describe what you hope to achieve with that major.",
